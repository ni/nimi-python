# Why Use A Configuration File?
# https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/index.html
# The main advantages of using a configuration file over the web interface are:
# * Settings are per version rather than per project.
# * Settings live in your VCS.
# * They enable reproducible build environments over time.
# * Some settings are only available using a configuration file

# Required
version: 2

# Set the version of Python and other tools you might need
build:
  os: ubuntu-22.04
  tools:
    python: "3.11"
  jobs:
    # pre_build:
    #   # Check for broken external links
    #   - python -m sphinx -b linkcheck -D linkcheck_timeout=1 docs/ _build/linkcheck
    post_checkout:
      # https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/build-customization.html#cancel-build-based-on-a-condition
      # Build-cancellation rules are recommended for monorepos.
      # Cancel building pull requests when there aren't changes in any of these paths: docs/_static/ docs/nitclk/.
      #
      # If there are no changes (git diff exits with 0) we force the command to return with 183.
      # This is a special exit code on Read the Docs that will cancel the build immediately.

# Have Read the Docs build documentation with Sphinx
sphinx:
  builder: html
  configuration: docs/nitclk/conf.py

# If using Sphinx, optionally build your docs in additional formats such as PDF
formats:
  - epub
  - pdf

# Optionally declare the Python requirements required to build your docs
# python:
#   install:
#   - requirements: docs/requirements.txt
