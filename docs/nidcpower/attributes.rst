    `niDCPower Get Next Interchange
    Warning <NIDCPowerVIRef.chm::/niDCPower_Get_Next_Interchange_Warning.html>`__

    When you set the `Samples to
    Average <pniDCPower_SamplesToAverage.html>`__ property in the `Running
    state <NI_DC_Power_Supplies_Help.chm::/programmingStates.html>`__, the
    output channel measurements might move out of synchronization. While
