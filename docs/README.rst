.. _about-section:

About
=====

The **nimi-python** repository generates Python bindings (Application Programming Interface) for interacting with the Modular Instrument drivers. Currently, the following drivers are supported:

* NI-DMM (Python module: nidmm)

It is implemented as a set of `Mako templates <http://makotemplates.org>`_ and per-driver metafiles that produce a Python module for each driver. The driver is called through its public C API using the
`ctypes <https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html>`_ Python library.

**nimi-python** supports only the Windows operating system.

** nimi-python** supports CPython 3.6+. * TODO(marcoskirsch): Add PyPI version here.*

.. _installation-section:

Installation
============

In order to use nimi-python modules, you must install the corresponding driver runtime on your system. Visit `ni.com/downloads <http://www.ni.com/downloads/>`_ to download the latest driver version for your devices.

Specific Python bindings (i.e. for **NI-DMM**) can be installed with `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_::

  $ python -m pip install nidmm

Or **easy_install** from
`setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_::

  $ python -m easy_install nidmm

You also can download the project source, build, and run::

  $ python TODO(marcoskirsch): how do we build?
  $ python setup.py install

.. _usage-section:

Usage
=====

The following is a basic example of using the **nidmm** module to open a session to a DMM and perform a 5.5 digits of resolution voltage measurement in the 10 V range.

.. code-block:: python

    import nidmm
    with nidmm.Session("Dev1") as session:
        session.configureMeasurementDigits(nidmm.Function.DC_VOLTS, 10, 5.5)
        print("Measurement: " + str(session.read()))
