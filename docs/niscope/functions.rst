niscope.Session methods
=======================

.. py:currentmodule:: niscope

.. function:: acquisition_status()

    Returns status information about the acquisition to the **status**
    output parameter.

    



    :rtype: :py:data:`niscope.AcquisitionStatus`
    :return:


            Returns whether the acquisition is complete, in progress, or unknown.

            **Defined Values**

            NISCOPE\_VAL\_ACQ\_COMPLETE

            NISCOPE\_VAL\_ACQ\_IN\_PROGRESS

            NISCOPE\_VAL\_ACQ\_STATUS\_UNKNOWN

            



.. function:: add_waveform_processing(meas_function)

    Adds one measurement to the list of processing steps that are completed
    before the measurement. The processing is added on a per channel basis,
    and the processing measurements are completed in the same order they are
    registered. All measurement library parameters—the attributes starting
    with :py:data:`niscope.MEAS`—are cached at the time of registering the
    processing, and this set of parameters is used during the processing
    step. The processing measurements are streamed, so the result of the
    first processing step is used as the input for the next step. The
    processing is done before any other measurements.

    


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the
        niscope.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an
        niscope.Session instance, and calling this method on the result.:

        .. code:: python

            session['0,1'].add_waveform_processing(meas_function)


    :param meas_function:


        The `array
        measurement <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_2(array_measurements_refs)>`__
        to add.

        


    :type meas_function: :py:data:`niscope.ArrayMeasurement`

.. function:: auto_setup()

    Automatically configures the instrument. When you call this function,
    the digitizer senses the input signal and automatically configures many
    of the instrument settings. If a signal is detected on a channel, the
    driver chooses the smallest available vertical range that is larger than
    the signal range. For example, if the signal is a 1.2 V\ :sub:`pk-pk`
    sine wave, and the device supports 1 V and 2 V vertical ranges, the
    driver will choose the 2 V vertical range for that channel.

    If no signal is found on any analog input channel, a warning is
    returned, and all channels are enabled. A channel is considered to have
    a signal present if the signal is at least 10% of the smallest vertical
    range available for that channel.

.. function:: cal_self_calibrate(option=niscope.Option.SELF_CALIBRATE_ALL_CHANNELS)

    Self-calibrates most NI digitizers, including all SMC-based devices and
    most Traditional NI-DAQ (Legacy) devices. To verify that your digitizer
    supports self-calibration, refer to `Features Supported by
    Device <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(features_supported_main)>`__.

    For SMC-based digitizers, if the self-calibration is performed
    successfully in a regular session, the calibration constants are
    immediately stored in the self-calibration area of the EEPROM. If the
    self-calibration is performed in an external calibration session, the
    calibration constants take effect immediately for the duration of the
    session. However, they are not stored in the EEPROM until
    :py:func:`niscope.CalEnd` is called with **action** set to
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_ACTION\_STORE and no errors occur.

            session['0,1'].cal_self_calibrate(option=niscope.Option.SELF_CALIBRATE_ALL_CHANNELS)


    :param option:


        The calibration option. Use VI\_NULL for a normal self-calibration
        operation or NISCOPE\_VAL\_CAL\_RESTORE\_EXTERNAL\_CALIBRATION to
        restore the previous calibration.

        


    :type option: :py:data:`niscope.Option`

.. function:: clear_waveform_measurement_stats(clearable_measurement_function=niscope.ClearableMeasurement.ALL_MEASUREMENTS)

    Clears the waveform stats on the channel and measurement you specify. If
    you want to clear all of the measurements, use
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_ALL\_MEASUREMENTS in the **clearableMeasurementFunction**
    parameter.

    Every time a measurement is called, the statistics information is
    updated, including the min, max, mean, standard deviation, and number of
    updates. This information is fetched with
    :py:func:`niscope.fetch_measurement_stats`. The multi-acquisition array measurements
    are also cleared with this function.

    :param clearable_measurement_function:


        The `scalar
        measurement <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_2(scalar_measurements_refs)>`__
        or `array
        measurement <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_2(array_measurements_refs)>`__
        to clear the stats for.

        


    :type clearable_measurement_function: :py:data:`niscope.ClearableMeasurement`

.. function:: clear_waveform_processing()

    Clears the list of processing steps assigned to the given channel. The
    processing is added using the :py:func:`niscope.add_waveform_processing` function,
    where the processing steps are completed in the same order in which they
    are registered. The processing measurements are streamed, so the result
    of the first processing step is used as the input for the next step. The
    processing is also done before any other measurements.

        value to use the hardware default bandwidth. Pass –1 for this value to
        achieve full bandwidth.

        


    :type max_input_frequency: float

.. function:: configure_equalization_filter_coefficients(coefficients)

    Configures the custom coefficients for the equalization FIR filter on
    the device. This filter is designed to compensate the input signal for
    artifacts introduced to the signal outside of the digitizer. Because
    this filter is a generic FIR filter, any coefficients are valid.
    Coefficient values should be between +1 and –1.

.. function:: configure_trigger_digital(trigger_source, slope=niscope.TriggerSlope.POSITIVE, holdoff=0.0, delay=0.0)

    Configures the common properties of a digital trigger.

    When you initiate an acquisition, the digitizer waits for the start
    trigger, which is configured through the :py:data:`niscope.ACQ\_ARM\_SOURCE`
    (Start Trigger Source) attribute. The default is immediate. Upon
    receiving the start trigger the digitizer begins sampling pretrigger
    points. After the digitizer finishes sampling pretrigger points, the
    digitizer waits for a reference (stop) trigger that you specify with a
    function such as this one. Upon receiving the reference trigger the
    digitizer finishes the acquisition after completing posttrigger
    sampling. With each Configure Trigger function, you specify
    configuration parameters such as the trigger source and the amount of
    trigger delay.

    

    .. note:: For multirecord acquisitions, all records after the first record are
        started by using the Advance Trigger Source. The default is immediate.

        You can adjust the amount of pre-trigger and post-trigger samples using
        the reference position parameter on the
        :py:func:`niscope.configure_horizontal_timing` function. The default is half of the
        record length.

        Some features are not supported by all digitizers. Refer to `Features
        Supported by
        Device <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(features_supported_main)>`__ for

    Configures common properties for analog hysteresis triggering. This kind
    of trigger specifies an additional value, specified in the
    **hysteresis** parameter, that a signal must pass through before a
    trigger can occur. This additional value acts as a kind of buffer zone
    that keeps noise from triggering an acquisition.

.. function:: configure_trigger_immediate()

    Configures common properties for immediate triggering. Immediate
    triggering means the digitizer triggers itself.

    When you initiate an acquisition, the digitizer waits for a trigger. You

.. function:: configure_trigger_video(trigger_source, signal_format, event, polarity, trigger_coupling, enable_dc_restore=False, line_number=1, holdoff=0.0, delay=0.0)

    Configures the common properties for video triggering, including the
    signal format, TV event, line number, polarity, and enable DC restore. A
    video trigger occurs when the digitizer finds a valid video signal sync.

    When you initiate an acquisition, the digitizer waits for the start
    trigger, which is configured through the :py:data:`niscope.ACQ\_ARM\_SOURCE`
    (Start Trigger Source) attribute. The default is immediate. Upon
    receiving the start trigger the digitizer begins sampling pretrigger
    points. After the digitizer finishes sampling pretrigger points, the
    digitizer waits for a reference (stop) trigger that you specify with a
    function such as this one. Upon receiving the reference trigger the
    digitizer finishes the acquisition after completing posttrigger
    sampling. With each Configure Trigger function, you specify
    configuration parameters such as the trigger source and the amount of
    trigger delay.

.. function:: export_signal(signal, output_terminal, signal_identifier='None')

    Configures the digitizer to generate a signal that other devices can
    detect when configured for digital triggering or sharing clocks. The
    **signal** parameter specifies what condition causes the digitizer to
    generate the signal. The **outputTerminal** parameter specifies where to
    send the signal on the hardware (such as a PFI connector or RTSI line).

    In cases where multiple instances of a particular signal exist, use the
    **signalIdentifier** input to specify which instance to control. For
    normal signals, only one instance exists and you should leave this
    parameter set to the empty string. You can call this function multiple
    times and set each available line to a different signal.

    To unprogram a specific line on device, call this function with the
    signal you no longer want to export and set **outputTerminal** to
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_NONE.

    

    .. note:: This function replaces :py:func:`niscope.ConfigureTriggerOutput`.

.. function:: fetch(timeout, num_samples)

    Returns the waveform from a previously initiated acquisition that the
    digitizer acquires for the specified channel. This function returns
    scaled voltage waveforms.

    This function may return multiple waveforms depending on the number of
    channels, the acquisition type, and the number of records you specify.

    

    .. note:: You can use :py:func:`niscope.read` instead of this function. :py:func:`niscope.read`
        starts an acquisition on all enabled channels, waits for the acquisition
        to complete, and returns the waveform for the specified channel.

        Some functionality, such as time stamping, is not supported in all
        digitizers. Refer to `Features Supported by
        Device <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(features_supported_main)>`__ for
        more information.


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the

        .. code:: python

            session['0,1'].fetch(timeout, num_samples)


    :param timeout:


        The time to wait in seconds for data to be acquired; using 0 for this
        parameter tells NI-SCOPE to fetch whatever is currently available. Using
        -1 for this parameter implies infinite timeout.

        


    :type timeout: float
    :param num_samples:


        The maximum number of samples to fetch for each waveform. If the
        acquisition finishes with fewer points than requested, some devices
        return partial data if the acquisition finished, was aborted, or a
        timeout of 0 was used. If it fails to complete within the timeout
        period, the function returns an error.

            waveforms. Call :py:func:`niscope.ActualNumwfms` to determine the number of
            waveforms.

            NI-SCOPE returns this data sequentially, so all record 0 waveforms are
            first. For example, with a channel list of 0,1, you would have the
            following index values:

            index 0 = record 0, channel 0

            index *x* = record 0, channel 1

               first sample in the fetched waveform
            -  **absoluteInitialX**—timestamp (in seconds) of the first fetched
               sample. This timestamp is comparable between records and
               acquisitions; devices that do not support this parameter use 0 for
               this output.
            -  **xIncrement**—the time between points in the acquired waveform in
               seconds
            -  **actualSamples**—the actual number of samples fetched and placed in
               the waveform array
            -  **gain**—the gain factor of the given channel; useful for scaling
               binary data with the following formula:

            voltage = binary data × gain factor + offset

            -  **offset**—the offset factor of the given channel; useful for scaling
               binary data with the following formula:

            voltage = binary data × gain factor + offset

            Call :py:func:`niscope._actual_num_wfms` to determine the size of this array.

            



.. function:: fetch_array_measurement(timeout, array_meas_function, meas_wfm_size)

    Obtains a waveform from the digitizer and returns the specified
    measurement array. This function may return multiple waveforms depending
    on the number of channels, the acquisition type, and the number of
    records you specify.

.. function:: fetch_measurement(scalar_meas_function, timeout=5.0)

    Fetches a waveform from the digitizer and performs the specified
    waveform measurement. Refer to `Using Fetch
    Functions <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(using_fetch_functions)>`__ for
    more information.

    Many of the measurements use the low, mid, and high reference levels.
    You configure the low, mid, and high references by using
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_LOW\_REF\_LEVEL`,
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_MID\_REF\_LEVEL`, and
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_HIGH\_REF\_LEVEL` to set each channel
    differently.

    


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the
        niscope.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an
        niscope.Session instance, and calling this method on the result.:

        .. code:: python

            session['0,1'].fetch_measurement(scalar_meas_function, timeout=5.0)


    :param scalar_meas_function:


        The `scalar
        measurement <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_2(scalar_measurements_refs)>`__
        to be performed.

        


    :type scalar_meas_function: :py:data:`niscope.ScalarMeasurement`
    :param timeout:


        The time to wait in seconds for data to be acquired; using 0 for this
        parameter tells NI-SCOPE to fetch whatever is currently available. Using
        -1 for this parameter implies infinite timeout.

        


    :type timeout: float

    :rtype: list of float
    :return:


            Contains an array of all measurements acquired; call
            :py:func:`niscope._actual_num_wfms` to determine the array length.

            



.. function:: fetch_measurement_stats(scalar_meas_function, timeout=5.0)

    Obtains a waveform measurement and returns the measurement value. This
    function may return multiple statistical results depending on the number
    of channels, the acquisition type, and the number of records you
    specify.

    You specify a particular measurement type, such as rise time, frequency,
    or voltage peak-to-peak. The waveform on which the digitizer calculates
    the waveform measurement is from an acquisition that you previously
    initiated. The statistics for the specified measurement function are
    returned, where the statistics are updated once every acquisition when
    the specified measurement is fetched by any of the Fetch Measurement
    functions. If a Fetch Measurement function has not been called, this
    function fetches the data on which to perform the measurement. The
    statistics are cleared by calling
    :py:func:`niscope.clear_waveform_measurement_stats`. Refer to `Using Fetch
    Functions <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(using_fetch_functions)>`__ for
    more information on incorporating fetch functions in your application.

    Many of the measurements use the low, mid, and high reference levels.
    You configure the low, mid, and high references with
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_LOW\_REF\_LEVEL`,
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_MID\_REF\_LEVEL`, and
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_HIGH\_REF\_LEVEL` to set each channel
    differently.

        WHERE

        result (list of float): 


            Returns the resulting measurement

            


        mean (list of float): 


            Returns the mean scalar value, which is obtained by averaging each
            :py:func:`niscope.fetch_measurement_stats` call.

            


        stdev (list of float): 


            Returns the standard deviation of the most recent **numInStats**
            measurements.

            


        min (list of float): 


            Returns the smallest scalar value acquired (the minimum of the

        max (list of float): 


            Returns the largest scalar value acquired (the maximum of the

.. function:: get_equalization_filter_coefficients(number_of_coefficients)

    Retrieves the custom coefficients for the equalization FIR filter on the
    device. This filter is designed to compensate the input signal for
    artifacts introduced to the signal outside of the digitizer. Because
    this filter is a generic FIR filter, any coefficients are valid.
    Coefficient values should be between +1 and –1.

    


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the
        niscope.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.

            attribute.

            



.. function:: probe_compensation_signal_start()

    Starts the 1 kHz square wave output on PFI 1 for probe compensation.

    



.. function:: probe_compensation_signal_stop()

    Stops the 1 kHz square wave output on PFI 1 for probe compensation.

    



.. function:: read(timeout, num_samples)

    Initiates an acquisition, waits for it to complete, and retrieves the
    data. The process is similar to calling :py:func:`niscope._initiate_acquisition`,
    :py:func:`niscope.acquisition_status`, and :py:func:`niscope.fetch`. The only difference is
    that with :py:func:`niscope.read`, you enable all channels specified with
    **channelList** before the acquisition; in the other method, you enable
    the channels with :py:func:`niscope.configure_vertical`.

    This function may return multiple waveforms depending on the number of
    channels, the acquisition type, and the number of records you specify.

    

    .. note:: Some functionality is not supported in all digitizers. Refer to
        `Features Supported by
        Device <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(features_supported_main)>`__ for

    :param timeout:


        The time to wait in seconds for data to be acquired; using 0 for this
        parameter tells NI-SCOPE to fetch whatever is currently available. Using
        -1 for this parameter implies infinite timeout.

        


    :type timeout: float
    :param num_samples:


        The maximum number of samples to fetch for each waveform. If the
        acquisition finishes with fewer points than requested, some devices
        return partial data if the acquisition finished, was aborted, or a
        timeout of 0 was used. If it fails to complete within the timeout
        period, the function returns an error.

        


    :type num_samples: int

    :rtype: tuple (wfm, wfm_info)

        WHERE

        wfm (list of float): 


            Returns an array whose length is the **numSamples** times number of
            waveforms. Call :py:func:`niscope.ActualNumwfms` to determine the number of
            waveforms.

            NI-SCOPE returns this data sequentially, so all record 0 waveforms are
            first. For example, with a channel list of 0,1, you would have the
            following index values:

            index 0 = record 0, channel 0

            index *x* = record 0, channel 1

            index 2\ *x* = record 1, channel 0

            index 3\ *x* = record 1, channel 1

            Where *x* = the record length

            


        wfm_info (list of WaveformInfo): 


            Returns an array of structures with the following timing and scaling
            information about each waveform:

            -  **relativeInitialX**—the time (in seconds) from the trigger to the
               first sample in the fetched waveform
            -  **absoluteInitialX**—timestamp (in seconds) of the first fetched
               sample. This timestamp is comparable between records and
               acquisitions; devices that do not support this parameter use 0 for
               this output.
            -  **xIncrement**—the time between points in the acquired waveform in
               seconds
            -  **actualSamples**—the actual number of samples fetched and placed in
               the waveform array
            -  **gain**—the gain factor of the given channel; useful for scaling
               binary data with the following formula:

            voltage = binary data × gain factor + offset

            -  **offset**—the offset factor of the given channel; useful for scaling
               binary data with the following formula:

            voltage = binary data × gain factor + offset

            Call :py:func:`niscope._actual_num_wfms` to determine the size of this array.

            



.. function:: read_measurement(scalar_meas_function, timeout=5.0)
