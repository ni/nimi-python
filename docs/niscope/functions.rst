niscope.Session methods
=======================

.. py:currentmodule:: niscope

.. function:: acquisition_status()

    Returns status information about the acquisition to the **status**
    output parameter.

    



    :rtype: int
    :return:


            Returns whether the acquisition is complete, in progress, or unknown.

            **Defined Values**

            NISCOPE\_VAL\_ACQ\_COMPLETE

            NISCOPE\_VAL\_ACQ\_IN\_PROGRESS

            NISCOPE\_VAL\_ACQ\_STATUS\_UNKNOWN

            



.. function:: actual_meas_wfm_size(array_meas_function)

    Returns the total available size of an array measurement acquisition.

    



    :param array_meas_function:


        The `array
        measurement <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_2(array_measurements_refs)>`__
        to perform.

        


    :type array_meas_function: int

    :rtype: int
    :return:


            Returns the size (in number of samples) of the resulting analysis
            waveform.

            



.. function:: actual_num_wfms()

    Helps you to declare appropriately sized waveforms. NI-SCOPE handles the
    channel list parsing for you.

    


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the
        niscope.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an
        niscope.Session instance, and calling this method on the result.:

        .. code:: python

            session['0,1'].actual_num_wfms()


    :rtype: int
    :return:


            Returns the number of records times the number of channels; if you are
            operating in DDC mode (NI 5620/5621 only), this value is multiplied by
            two.

            



.. function:: actual_record_length()

    Returns the actual number of points the digitizer acquires for each
    channel. After configuring the digitizer for an acquisition, call this
    function to determine the size of the waveforms that the digitizer
    acquires. The value is equal to or greater than the minimum number of
    points specified in any of the Configure Horizontal functions.

    



    :rtype: int
    :return:


            Returns the actual number of points the digitizer acquires for each
            channel; NI-SCOPE returns the value held in the
            :py:data:`niscope.HORZ\_RECORD\_LENGTH` attribute.

            



.. function:: add_waveform_processing(meas_function)

    Adds one measurement to the list of processing steps that are completed
    before the measurement. The processing is added on a per channel basis,
    and the processing measurements are completed in the same order they are
    registered. All measurement library parameters—the attributes starting
    with :py:data:`niscope.MEAS`—are cached at the time of registering the
    processing, and this set of parameters is used during the processing
    step. The processing measurements are streamed, so the result of the
    first processing step is used as the input for the next step. The
    processing is done before any other measurements.

    


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the
        niscope.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an
        niscope.Session instance, and calling this method on the result.:

        .. code:: python

            session['0,1'].add_waveform_processing(meas_function)


    :param meas_function:


        The `array
        measurement <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_2(array_measurements_refs)>`__
        to add.

        


    :type meas_function: int

.. function:: adjust_sample_clock_relative_delay(delay)

    Configures the relative sample clock delay (in seconds) when using the
    internal clock. Each time this function is called, the sample clock is
    delayed from the reference clock by the specified amount of time.

    



    :param delay:


        How long the digitizer waits after receiving the trigger to start
        acquiring data. Refer to :py:data:`niscope.TRIGGER\_DELAY\_TIME` for more
        information.

        


    :type delay: float

.. function:: auto_setup()

    Automatically configures the instrument. When you call this function,
    the digitizer senses the input signal and automatically configures many
    of the instrument settings. If a signal is detected on a channel, the
    driver chooses the smallest available vertical range that is larger than
    the signal range. For example, if the signal is a 1.2 V\ :sub:`pk-pk`
    sine wave, and the device supports 1 V and 2 V vertical ranges, the
    driver will choose the 2 V vertical range for that channel.

    If no signal is found on any analog input channel, a warning is
    returned, and all channels are enabled. A channel is considered to have
    a signal present if the signal is at least 10% of the smallest vertical
    range available for that channel.

.. function:: cal_self_calibrate(option)

    Self-calibrates most NI digitizers, including all SMC-based devices and
    most Traditional NI-DAQ (Legacy) devices. To verify that your digitizer
    supports self-calibration, refer to `Features Supported by
    Device <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(features_supported_main)>`__.

    For SMC-based digitizers, if the self-calibration is performed
    successfully in a regular session, the calibration constants are
    immediately stored in the self-calibration area of the EEPROM. If the
    self-calibration is performed in an external calibration session, the
    calibration constants take effect immediately for the duration of the
    session. However, they are not stored in the EEPROM until
    :py:func:`niscope.CalEnd` is called with **action** set to
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_ACTION\_STORE and no errors occur.

.. function:: configure_edge_trigger_source(source, level, slope)

    Sets the edge triggering attributes. An edge trigger occurs when the
    trigger signal specified with the source parameter passes through the
    voltage threshold specified with the level parameter and has the slope
    specified with the slope parameter.

    This function affects instrument behavior only if the triggerType is
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_EDGE. Set the trigger type and trigger coupling before
    calling this function.

    If the trigger source is one of the analog input channels, you must
    configure the vertical range, vertical offset, vertical coupling, probe
    attenuation, and the maximum input frequency before calling this
    function.

    When you initiate an acquisition, the digitizer waits for the start
    trigger, which is configured through the :py:data:`niscope.ACQ\_ARM\_SOURCE`
    (Start Trigger Source) attribute. The default is immediate. Upon
    receiving the start trigger the digitizer begins sampling pretrigger
    points. After the digitizer finishes sampling pretrigger points, the
    digitizer waits for a reference (stop) trigger that you specify with a
    function such as this one. Upon receiving the reference trigger the
    digitizer finishes the acquisition after completing posttrigger
    sampling. With each Configure Trigger function, you specify
    configuration parameters such as the trigger source and the amount of
    trigger delay.

    

    .. note:: For multirecord acquisitions, all records after the first record are
        started by using the Advance Trigger Source. The default is immediate.

        You can adjust the amount of pre-trigger and post-trigger samples using
        the reference position parameter on the
        :py:func:`niscope.configure_horizontal_timing` function. The default is half of the
        record length.

.. function:: configure_trigger_immediate()

    Configures common properties for immediate triggering. Immediate
    triggering means the digitizer triggers itself.

    When you initiate an acquisition, the digitizer waits for a trigger. You
    specify the type of trigger that the digitizer waits for with a
    Configure Trigger function, such as :py:func:`niscope.configure_trigger_immediate`.

    



.. function:: configure_trigger_output(trigger_event, trigger_output)

    Configures the digitizer to generate a signal pulse that other
    digitizers can detect when configured for digital triggering.

    For Traditional NI-DAQ devices, exported signals are still present in
    the route after the session is closed. You must clear the route before
    closing the session, or call :py:func:`niscope.reset`.

    To clear the route, call this function again and route
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_NONE to the line that you had exported. For example, if
    you originally called this function with the trigger event
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_STOP\_TRIGGER\_EVENT routed to the trigger output
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_RTSI\_0, you would call this function again with
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_NONE routed to NISCOPE\_VAL\_RTSI\_0 to clear the route.

    

    .. note:: This function is obsolete. Consider using :py:func:`niscope.export_signal`
        instead.

    :type delay: float

.. function:: configure_trigger_window(trigger_source, low_level, high_level, window_mode, trigger_coupling, holdoff, delay)

    Configures common properties for analog window triggering. A window
    trigger occurs when a signal enters or leaves a window you specify with
    the **high level** or **low level** parameters.

    When you initiate an acquisition, the digitizer waits for the start
    trigger, which is configured through the :py:data:`niscope.ACQ\_ARM\_SOURCE`
    (Start Trigger Source) attribute. The default is immediate. Upon
    receiving the start trigger the digitizer begins sampling pretrigger
    points. After the digitizer finishes sampling pretrigger points, the
    digitizer waits for a reference (stop) trigger that you specify with a
    function such as this one. Upon receiving the reference trigger the
    digitizer finishes the acquisition after completing posttrigger
    sampling. With each Configure Trigger function, you specify
    configuration parameters such as the trigger source and the amount of
    trigger delay.

    To trigger the acquisition, use :py:func:`niscope.send_software_trigger_edge`.

    

    .. note:: Some features are not supported by all digitizers. Refer to `Features
        Supported by

.. function:: disable()

    Aborts any current operation, opens data channel relays, and releases
    RTSI and PFI lines.

    



.. function:: export_signal(signal, signal_identifier, output_terminal)

    Configures the digitizer to generate a signal that other devices can
    detect when configured for digital triggering or sharing clocks. The
    **signal** parameter specifies what condition causes the digitizer to
    generate the signal. The **outputTerminal** parameter specifies where to
    send the signal on the hardware (such as a PFI connector or RTSI line).

    In cases where multiple instances of a particular signal exist, use the
    **signalIdentifier** input to specify which instance to control. For
    normal signals, only one instance exists and you should leave this
    parameter set to the empty string. You can call this function multiple
    times and set each available line to a different signal.

    To unprogram a specific line on device, call this function with the
    signal you no longer want to export and set **outputTerminal** to
    NISCOPE\_VAL\_NONE.

    

    .. note:: This function replaces :py:func:`niscope.configure_trigger_output`.

.. function:: fetch_measurement(timeout, scalar_meas_function)

    Fetches a waveform from the digitizer and performs the specified
    waveform measurement. Refer to `Using Fetch
    Functions <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(using_fetch_functions)>`__ for
    more information.

    Many of the measurements use the low, mid, and high reference levels.
    You configure the low, mid, and high references by using
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_LOW\_REF\_LEVEL`,
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_MID\_REF\_LEVEL`, and
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_HIGH\_REF\_LEVEL` to set each channel
    differently.

    :param timeout:


        The time to wait in seconds for data to be acquired; using 0 for this
        parameter tells NI-SCOPE to fetch whatever is currently available. Using
        -1 for this parameter implies infinite timeout.

.. function:: fetch_measurement_stats(timeout, scalar_meas_function)

    Obtains a waveform measurement and returns the measurement value. This
    function may return multiple statistical results depending on the number
    of channels, the acquisition type, and the number of records you
    specify.

    You specify a particular measurement type, such as rise time, frequency,
    or voltage peak-to-peak. The waveform on which the digitizer calculates
    the waveform measurement is from an acquisition that you previously
    initiated. The statistics for the specified measurement function are
    returned, where the statistics are updated once every acquisition when
    the specified measurement is fetched by any of the Fetch Measurement
    functions. If a Fetch Measurement function has not been called, this
    function fetches the data on which to perform the measurement. The
    statistics are cleared by calling
    :py:func:`niscope.clear_waveform_measurement_stats`. Refer to `Using Fetch
    Functions <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(using_fetch_functions)>`__ for
    more information on incorporating fetch functions in your application.

    Many of the measurements use the low, mid, and high reference levels.
    You configure the low, mid, and high references with
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_LOW\_REF\_LEVEL`,
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_MID\_REF\_LEVEL`, and

.. function:: fetch_waveform(channel, waveform_size)

    Returns the waveform from a previously initiated acquisition that the
    digitizer acquires for the channel you specify.

    :py:func:`niscope._initiate_acquisition` starts an acquisition on the channels that
    you enable with :py:func:`niscope.configure_vertical`. The digitizer acquires
    waveforms for the enabled channels concurrently. You use
    :py:func:`niscope.acquisition_status` to determine when the acquisition is
    complete. You must call this function separately for each enabled
    channel to obtain the waveforms.

    You can call :py:func:`niscope.read_waveform` instead of
    :py:func:`niscope._initiate_acquisition`. :py:func:`niscope.read_waveform` starts an
    acquisition on all enabled channels, waits for the acquisition to
    complete, and returns the waveform for the channel you specify. Call
    this function to obtain the waveforms for each of the remaining
    channels.

    

    .. note:: This function is included for compliance with the IviScope Class

            | Notes:
            | If the digitizer cannot sample a point in the waveform, this function
              returns an error.

            


        actual_points (int): 


            Indicates the actual number of points the function placed in the

            For example, if the digitizer acquires the first point in the
            **waveform** array 1 second before the trigger, this parameter returns
            the value –1.0. If the acquisition of the first point occurs at the same
            time as the trigger, this parameter returns the value 0.0.

        If the error description, including the terminating NULL byte, contains
        more bytes than you indicate in this parameter, the function copies
        BufferSize - 1 bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII NULL byte at the
        end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must pass to get the
        entire value. For example, if the value is "123456" and the Buffer Size
        is 4, the function places "123" into the buffer and returns 7.

        If you pass a negative number, the function copies the value to the
        buffer regardless of the number of bytes in the value.

        


    :type buffer_size: int

    :rtype: string
    :return:


            Returns the channel string that is in the channel table at the index you
            specify. Do not modify the contents of the channel string.

            



.. function:: get_equalization_filter_coefficients(number_of_coefficients)

    Retrieves the custom coefficients for the equalization FIR filter on the
    device. This filter is designed to compensate the input signal for
    artifacts introduced to the signal outside of the digitizer. Because
    this filter is a generic FIR filter, any coefficients are valid.
    Coefficient values should be between +1 and –1.

    


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the
        niscope.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an
        niscope.Session instance, and calling this method on the result.:

        .. code:: python

    :param number_of_coefficients:


        The number of coefficients being passed in the **coefficients** array.

        


    :type number_of_coefficients: int

    :rtype: list of float
    :return:


            The custom coefficients for the equalization FIR filter on the device.
            These coefficients should be between +1 and –1. You can obtain the
            number of coefficients from the
            `:py:data:`niscope.EQUALIZATION\_NUM\_COEFFICIENTS` <cviNISCOPE_ATTR_EQUALIZATION_NUM_COEFFICIENTS.html>`__

.. function:: get_error_message(error_code, buffer__size)

    Returns the error code from an NI-SCOPE function as a user-readable
    string. Use VI\_NULL as the default instrument handle.

    You must call this function twice. For the first call, set
    **bufferSize** to 0 to prevent the function from populating the error
    message. Instead, the function returns the size of the error string. Use
    the returned size to create a buffer, then call the function again,
    passing in the new buffer and setting **bufferSize** equal to the size
    that was returned in the first function call.

    



    :param error_code:


        The error code that is returned from any of the instrument driver
        functions.

        


    :type error_code: int
    :param buffer__size:


        The number of characters you specify for the **errorMessage** parameter.

        


    :type buffer__size: int

    :rtype: string
    :return:


            Returns a char buffer that will be populated with the error message. It
            should be at least as large as the buffer size.

            



.. function:: get_frequency_response(buffer_size, frequencies, amplitudes, phases)

    Gets the frequency response of the digitizer for the current
    configurations of the channel attributes. Not all digitizers support
    this function.

    


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the

    :param buffer_size:


        The array size for the frequencies, amplitudes, and phases arrays that
        you pass in to the other parameters.

        To determine the sizes of the buffers to allocate for the frequencies,
        amplitudes, and phases arrays, pass a value of 0 to the **buffer\_size**
        parameter and a value of NULL to the **frequencies** parameter. In this
        case, the value returned by the **numberOfFrequencies** parameter is the
        size of the arrays necessary to hold the frequencies, amplitudes, and
        phases. Allocate three arrays of this size, then call this function
        again (with correct **buffer\_size** parameter) to retrieve the actual
        values.

        


    :type buffer_size: int
    :param frequencies:


        The array of frequencies that corresponds with the amplitude and phase
        response of the device.

        


    :type frequencies: list of float

        The array of phases that correspond with the phase response of the
        device.

        


    :type phases: list of float

    :rtype: int
    :return:


            Returns the number of frequencies in the returned spectrum.

            



.. function:: get_stream_endpoint_handle(stream_name)

    Returns a writer endpoint that can be used with NI-P2P to configure a
    peer-to-peer stream with a digitizer endpoint.

    -  `Peer-to-Peer Streaming <digitizers.chm::/5160_P2P.html>`__

    



    :param stream_name:


        The stream endpoint FIFO to configure. Refer to the device-specific
        documentation for peer-to-peer streaming in the *High-Speed Digitizers
        Help* for more information.

        


    :type stream_name: string

    :rtype: int
    :return:


            Returns a reference to a peer-to-peer writer FIFO that can be used to
            create a peer-to-peer streaming session.

            



.. function:: is_device_ready(resource_name)

    Call this function to determine whether the device is ready for use or
    the device is still undergoing initialization.

    


    .. tip:: This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the
        niscope.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an

        .. code:: python

            session['0,1'].is_device_ready(resource_name)


    :param resource_name:


        .. caution:: Traditional NI-DAQ and NI-DAQmx device names are not case-sensitive.
            However, all IVI names, such as logical names, are case-sensitive. If
            you use logical names, driver session names, or virtual names in your
            program, you must make sure that the name you use matches the name in
            the IVI Configuration Store file exactly, without any variations in the
            case of the characters.

        **resourceName** specifies the resource name of the device to
        initialize.

        resourceName Examples

        For Traditional NI-DAQ devices, the syntax is DAQ::\ *n*, where *n* is
        the device number assigned by MAX, as shown in Example 1.

        For NI-DAQmx devices, the syntax is just the device name specified in
        MAX, as shown in Example 2. Typical default names for NI-DAQmx devices
        in MAX are Dev1 or PXI1Slot1. You can rename an NI-DAQmx device by
        right-clicking on the name in MAX and entering a new name.

        An alternate syntax for NI-DAQmx devices consists of DAQ::\ *NI-DAQmx
        device name*, as shown in Example 3. This naming convention allows for
        the use of an NI-DAQmx device in an application that was originally
        designed for a Traditional NI-DAQ device. For example, if the
        application expects DAQ::1, you can rename the NI-DAQmx device to 1 in
        MAX and pass in DAQ::1 for the resource name, as shown in Example 4.

        If you use the DAQ::\ *n* syntax and an NI-DAQmx device name already
        exists with that same name, the NI-DAQmx device is matched first.

        You can also pass in the name of an IVI logical name or an IVI virtual
        name configured with the IVI Configuration utility, as shown in Example
        5. A logical name identifies a particular virtual instrument. A virtual
        name identifies a specific device and specifies the initial settings for
        the session.

.. function:: is_invalid_wfm_element(element_value)

    Determines whether a value you pass from the waveform array is invalid.
    After the read and fetch waveform functions execute, each element in the
    waveform array contains either a voltage or a value indicating that the
    instrument could not sample a voltage.

        Pass one of the values from the waveform array returned by the read and
        fetch waveform functions.

        


    :type element_value: float

    :rtype: bool
    :return:


            Returns whether the element value is a valid voltage or a value
            indicating that the digitizer could not sample a voltage.

            Return values:

            | VI\_TRUE—The element value indicates that the instrument could not
              sample the voltage.
            | VI\_FALSE—The element value is a valid voltage.

.. function:: read_measurement(timeout, scalar_meas_function)

    Initiates an acquisition, waits for it to complete, and performs the
    specified waveform measurement for a single channel and record or for
    multiple channels and records.

    Refer to `Using Fetch
    Functions <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(using_fetch_functions)>`__ for
    more information.

    Many of the measurements use the low, mid, and high reference levels.
    You configure the low, mid, and high references by using
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_LOW\_REF\_LEVEL`,
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_MID\_REF\_LEVEL`, and
    :py:data:`niscope.MEAS\_CHAN\_HIGH\_REF\_LEVEL` to set each channel
    differently.

        The time to wait in seconds for data to be acquired; using 0 for this
        parameter tells NI-SCOPE to fetch whatever is currently available. Using
        -1 for this parameter implies infinite timeout.

.. function:: read_waveform(channel, waveform_size, max_time)

    Initiates an acquisition on the channels that you enable with
    :py:func:`niscope.configure_vertical`. This function then waits for the acquisition
    to complete and returns the waveform for the channel you specify. Call
    :py:func:`niscope.fetch_waveform` to obtain the waveforms for each of the remaining
    enabled channels without initiating another acquisition.

    Use :py:func:`niscope.actual_record_length` to determine the required size for the
    **waveform** array.

    

    .. note:: This function is included for compliance with the IviScope Class
        Specification.

    :param max_time:


        Pass the maximum length of time in which to allow the read waveform
        operation to complete.

        If the operation does not complete within this time interval, the
        function returns the NISCOPE\_ERROR\_MAX\_TIME\_EXCEEDED error code.
        When this occurs, you can call :py:func:`niscope._abort` to cancel the read
        waveform operation and return the digitizer to the idle state.

            For example, if the digitizer acquires the first point in the
            **waveform** array 1 second before the trigger, this parameter returns
            the value –1.0. If the acquisition of the first point occurs at the same
            time as the trigger, this parameter returns the value 0.0.

.. function:: read_waveform_measurement(channel, meas_function, max_time)

    Initiates a new waveform acquisition and returns a specified waveform
    measurement from a specific channel.

    This function initiates an acquisition on the channels that you enable
    with the :py:func:`niscope.configure_vertical` function. It then waits for the
    acquisition to complete, obtains a waveform measurement on the channel
    you specify, and returns the measurement value. You specify a particular
    measurement type, such as rise time, frequency, or voltage peak-to-peak.

    You can call the :py:func:`niscope.fetch_waveform_measurement` function separately
    to obtain any other waveform measurement on a specific channel without
    initiating another acquisition.
