Usage
------

The following is a basic example of using the **nidcpower** module to open a session to a Source Meter Unit and measure voltage and current.

.. code-block:: python

    import nidcpower
    # Configure the session.

    with nidcpower.Session(resource_name='PXI1Slot2/0') as session:
        session.measure_record_length = 20
        session.measure_record_length_is_finite = True
        session.measure_when = nidcpower.MeasureWhen.AUTOMATICALLY_AFTER_SOURCE_COMPLETE
        session.voltage_level = 5.0

        session.commit()
        print('Effective measurement rate: {} S/s'.format(session.measure_record_delta_time / 1))

        samples_acquired = 0
        print('Channel           Num  Voltage    Current    In Compliance')
        row_format = '{0:15} {1:3d}    {2:8.6f}   {3:8.6f}   {4}'
        with session.initiate():
            channel_indices = '0-{}'.format(session.channel_count - 1)
            channels = session.get_channel_names(channel_indices)
            for i, channel_name in enumerate(channels):
                samples_acquired = 0
                while samples_acquired < 20:
                    measurements = session.channels[channel_name].fetch_multiple(count=session.fetch_backlog)
                    samples_acquired += len(measurements)
                    for i in range(len(measurements)):
                        print(row_format.format(channel_name, i, measurements[i].voltage, measurements[i].current, measurements[i].in_compliance))
