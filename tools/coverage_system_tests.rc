    ; Most of the lines in *_pb2.py are only used for the pure-Python implementation of protobuf, and the default implementation nowadays is the upb C implementation.

    ; *_pb2_grpc.py defines a stub, a servicer, and an "experimental API", and we only use the stub.
    ; If our system test coverage of the stub_interpreter is okay, we should be in good shape.
