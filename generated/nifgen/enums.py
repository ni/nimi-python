    Single Trigger Mode - The waveform you describe in the sequence list is  generated only once by going through the entire staging list. Only one  trigger is required to start the waveform generation. You can use Single  trigger mode with the output mode in any mode.

    Continuous Trigger Mode - The waveform you describe in the staging list generates infinitely by repeatedly cycling through the staging list.  After a trigger is received, the waveform generation starts from the  first stage and continues through to the last stage. After the last stage  completes, the waveform generation loops back to the start of the  first stage and continues until it is stopped. Only one trigger is  required to start the waveform generation.

    Stepped Trigger Mode - After a start trigger is received, the waveform  described by the first stage generates. Then, the device waits for the  next trigger signal. On the next trigger, the waveform described by the  second stage generates, and so on. After the staging list completes,  the waveform generation returns to the first stage and continues in a  cyclic fashion. After any stage has generated completely, the first  eight samples of the next stage are repeated continuously until the next  trigger is received.

    Burst Trigger Mode - After a start trigger is received, the waveform  described by the first stage generates until another trigger is  received. At the next trigger, the buffer of the previous stage completes, and then the waveform described by the second stage generates. After the staging list completes, the waveform generation  returns to the first stage and continues in a cyclic fashion. In  Frequency List mode, the duration instruction is ignored, and the trigger  switches the frequency to the next frequency in the list.
