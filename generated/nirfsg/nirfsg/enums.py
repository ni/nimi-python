    Specifies Script Trigger 3.
    '''
    NONE = ''
    r'''
    None (no signal to export)
    '''


class UpconverterFrequencyOffsetMode(Enum):
    AUTO = -1
    r'''
    NI-RFSG places the upconverter center frequency outside of the signal bandwidth if the signal_bandwidth property has been set and can be avoided.
    '''
    ENABLE = 1
    r'''
    NI-RFSG places the upconverter center frequency outside of the signal bandwidth if the signal_bandwidth property has been set and can be avoided. NI-RFSG returns an error if the signal_bandwidth property has not been set, or if the signal bandwidth is too large.
    '''
    USER_DEFINED = 5001
    r'''
    NI-RFSG uses the offset that you specified with the upconverter_frequency_offset or upconverter_center_frequency properties.
    '''


class WriteWaveformBurstDetection(Enum):
    DISABLE = 0
    r'''
    Burst detection is disabled.
    '''
    ENABLE = 1
    r'''
    Burst detection is enabled.
    '''


class WriteWaveformBurstDetectionMode(Enum):
    AUTO = -1
    r'''
    NI-RFSG automatically detects the burst start and burst stop locations by analyzing the waveform.
    '''
    MANUAL = 0
    r'''
    User sets the burst detection parameters.
    '''


class WriteWaveformNormalization(Enum):
    DISABLE = 0
    r'''
    Disables normalization on the waveform.
    '''
    ENABLE = 1
    r'''
    Enables normalization on a waveform to transform the waveform data so that its maximum is 1.00 and its minimum is -1.00
    '''
