    SOFTWARE = 2
    r'''
    The data operation does not start until a software event occurs. You may create a software trigger by calling the send_software_edge_trigger method.
    '''
    P2P_ENDPOINT_FULLNESS = 3
    r'''
    The data operation does not start until the endpoint reaches the threshold specified in the p2p_endpoint_fullness_start_trigger_level property.
    '''


class UpconverterFrequencyOffsetMode(Enum):
    AUTO = -1
    r'''
    NI-RFSG places the upconverter center frequency outside of the signal bandwidth if the signal_bandwidth property has been set and can be avoided.
    '''
    ENABLE = 1
    r'''
    NI-RFSG places the upconverter center frequency outside of the signal bandwidth if the signal_bandwidth property has been set and can be avoided. NI-RFSG returns an error if the signal_bandwidth property has not been set, or if the signal bandwidth is too large.
    '''
    USER_DEFINED = 5001
    r'''
    NI-RFSG uses the offset that you specified with the upconverter_frequency_offset or upconverter_center_frequency properties.
    '''


class WriteWaveformBurstDetection(Enum):
    DISABLE = 0
    r'''
    Burst detection is disabled.
    '''
    ENABLE = 1
    r'''
    Burst detection is enabled.
    '''


class WriteWaveformBurstDetectionMode(Enum):
    AUTO = -1
    r'''
    NI-RFSG automatically detects the burst start and burst stop locations by analyzing the waveform.
    '''
    MANUAL = 0
    r'''
    User sets the burst detection parameters.
    '''


class WriteWaveformNormalization(Enum):
    DISABLE = 0
    r'''
    Disables normalization on the waveform.
    '''
    ENABLE = 1
    r'''
    Enables normalization on a waveform to transform the waveform data so that its maximum is 1.00 and its minimum is -1.00
    '''


class YigMainCoilDrive(Enum):
    MANUAL = 0
    r'''
    Adjusts the YIG main coil for an underdamped response.
    '''
    FAST = 1
    r'''
    Adjusts the YIG main coil for an overdamped response.
    '''
