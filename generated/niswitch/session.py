        '''_set_attribute_vi_boolean

        This function sets the value of a ViBoolean attribute. This is a
        low-level function that you can use to set the values of
        instrument-specific attributes and inherent IVI attributes. If the
        attribute represents an instrument state, this function performs
        instrument I/O in the following cases: - State caching is disabled for
        the entire session or for the particular attribute. - State caching is
        enabled and the currently cached value is invalid or is different than
        the value you specify. This instrument driver contains high-level
        functions that set most of the instrument attributes. It is best to use
        the high-level driver functions as much as possible. They handle order
        dependencies and multithread locking for you. In addition, they perform
        status checking only after setting all of the attributes. In contrast,
        when you set multiple attributes using the SetAttribute functions, the
        functions check the instrument status after each call. Also, when state
        caching is enabled, the high-level functions that configure multiple
        attributes perform instrument I/O only for the attributes whose value
        you change. Thus, you can safely call the high-level functions without
        the penalty of redundant instrument I/O.

        Tip:
        This method requires repeated capabilities (usually channels). If called directly on the
        niswitch.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an
        niswitch.Session instance, and calling this method on the result.:

                the attribute names in the list box. The data types that are not

                NISWITCH_VAL_PATH_AVAILABLE indicates that the driver can create the
                path at this time. (2) NISWITCH_VAL_PATH_EXISTS indicates that the
                path already exists. (3) NISWITCH_VAL_PATH_UNSUPPORTED indicates that
                the instrument is not capable of creating a path between the channels
                you specify. (4) NISWITCH_VAL_RSRC_IN_USE indicates that although
                the path is valid, the driver cannot create the path at this moment
                because the switch device is currently using one or more of the required
                channels to create another path. You must destroy the other path before
                creating this one. (5) NISWITCH_VAL_SOURCE_CONFLICT indicates that
                the instrument cannot create a path because both channels are connected
                to a different source channel. (6)
                NISWITCH_VAL_CHANNEL_NOT_AVAILABLE indicates that the driver cannot
                create a path between the two channels because one of the channels is a
                configuration channel and thus unavailable for external connections.

        the switch module supports scanning. configure_scan_trigger sets
        the location that the switch expects to receive an input trigger to

                creates a path until it asserts a trigger on the scan advanced output
                line. The driver uses this value to set the Scan Delay attribute. The
                scan delay is in addition to the settling time.The driver uses this
                value to set the SCAN_DELAY attribute. Express this
                value in seconds. Default value: 0.0 s
            trigger_input (enums.TriggerInput): Trigger source you want the switch module to use during scanning. The

                attribute. The switch device waits for the trigger you specify when it
                encounters a semicolon in the scanlist. When the trigger occurs, the

                After the switch processes each entry in the scan list, it waits the

    def get_relay_count(self, relay_name):

        Returns the number of times the relay has changed from Closed to Open.
        Relay count is useful for tracking relay lifetime and usage. Call
        wait_for_debounce before get_relay_count to ensure an
        accurate count. Refer to the Relay Count topic in the NI Switches Help
        to determine if the switch module supports relay counting.

                ch0, ab0, 1wire, hlselect Refer to Devices Overview for a list of valid
                relay names for the switch module.

    def get_relay_name(self, index):

        Returns the relay name string that is in the relay list at the specified
        index. Use get_relay_name in a For Loop to get a complete list
        of valid relay names for the switch module. Use the Number of Relays
        attribute to determine the number of relays.

        Args:
            index (int): A 1-based index into the channel table. Default value: 1 Maximum value:
                Value of Channel Count attribute.
            relay_name_buffer_size (int): Pass the number of bytes in the ViChar array you specify for the Relay
                Name Buffer parameter. If the relay name string, including the
                terminating NUL byte, contains more bytes than you indicate in this
                parameter, the function copies Buffer Size - 1 bytes into the buffer,
                places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the
                buffer size you must pass to get the entire value. For example, if the
                value is "123456" and the Buffer Size is 4, the function places "123"
                into the buffer and returns 7. If you pass a negative number, the
                function copies the value to the buffer regardless of the number of
                bytes in the value. If you pass 0, you can pass VI_NULL for the
                Coercion Record buffer parameter. Default Value: None

        Returns a session handle used to identify the switch in all subsequent
        instrument driver calls and sets the topology of the switch.
        init_with_topology creates a new IVI instrument driver session
        for the switch specified in the resourceName parameter. The driver uses
        the topology specified in the topology parameter and overrides the
        topology specified in MAX. Note: When initializing an NI SwitchBlock
        device with topology, you must specify the toplogy created when you
        configured the device in MAX, using either
        NISWITCH_TOPOLOGY_CONFIGURED_TOPOLOGY or the toplogy string of the
        device. Refer to the Initializing with Toplogy for NI SwitchBlock
        Devices topic in the NI Switches Help for information about determining
        the topology string of an NI SwitchBlock device. By default, the switch
        is reset to a known state. Enable simulation by specifying the topology
        and setting the simulate parameter to VI_TRUE.
