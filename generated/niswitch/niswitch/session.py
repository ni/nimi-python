        This method retrieves and then clears the IVI error information for
        the session or the current execution thread. One exception exists: If
        the buffer_size parameter is 0, the method does not clear the error
        information. By passing 0 for the buffer size, the caller can ascertain
        the buffer size required to get the entire error description string and
        then call the method again with a sufficiently large buffer. If the
        user specifies a valid IVI session for the InstrumentHandle parameter,
        Get Error retrieves and then clears the error information for the
        session. If the user passes VI_NULL for the InstrumentHandle parameter,
        this method retrieves and then clears the error information for the
        current execution thread. If the InstrumentHandle parameter is an
        invalid session, the method does nothing and returns an error.
        Normally, the error information describes the first error that occurred
        since the user last called _get_error or ClearError.

        Note:
        One or more of the referenced methods are not in the Python API for this driver.

        Returns:
            code (int): Returns the error code for the session or execution thread. If you pass
                0 for the Buffer Size, you can pass VI_NULL for this parameter.

            description (str): Returns the error description for the IVI session or execution thread.
                If there is no description, the method returns an empty string. The
                buffer must contain at least as many elements as the value you specify
                with the Buffer Size parameter. If the error description, including the
                terminating NUL byte, contains more bytes than you indicate with the
                Buffer Size parameter, the method copies Buffer Size - 1 bytes into
                the buffer, places an ASCII NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and
                returns the buffer size you must pass to get the entire value. For

        Obtains a multithread lock on the device session. Before doing so, the
        software waits until all other execution threads release their locks
        on the device session.

        Other threads may have obtained a lock on this session for the
        following reasons:

            -  The application called the lock method.
            -  A call to NI-SWITCH locked the session.
            -  After a call to the lock method returns
               successfully, no other threads can access the device session until
               you call the unlock method or exit out of the with block when using
               lock context manager.
            -  Use the lock method and the
               unlock method around a sequence of calls to
               instrument driver methods if you require that the device retain its
               settings through the end of the sequence.

        You can safely make nested calls to the lock method
        within the same thread. To completely unlock the session, you must
        balance each call to the lock method with a call to
        the unlock method.

        Returns:
            lock (context manager): When used in a with statement, niswitch.Session.lock acts as
            a context manager and unlock will be called when the with block is exited

        This method sets the value of a ViBoolean property. This is a
        low-level method that you can use to set the values of
        instrument-specific properties and inherent IVI properties. If the
        property represents an instrument state, this method performs
        instrument I/O in the following cases: - State caching is disabled for
        the entire session or for the particular property. - State caching is
        enabled and the currently cached value is invalid or is different than
        the value you specify. This instrument driver contains high-level
        methods that set most of the instrument properties. It is best to use
        the high-level driver methods as much as possible. They handle order
        dependencies and multithread locking for you. In addition, they perform
        status checking only after setting all of the properties. In contrast,
        when you set multiple properties using the SetAttribute methods, the
        methods check the instrument status after each call. Also, when state
        caching is enabled, the high-level methods that configure multiple
        properties perform instrument I/O only for the properties whose value
        you change. Thus, you can safely call the high-level methods without
        the penalty of redundant instrument I/O.

        Tip:
        This method requires repeated capabilities. If called directly on the
        niswitch.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an
        niswitch.Session repeated capabilities container, and calling this method on the result.

        for the switch specified in the resourceName parameter. The driver uses
        the topology specified in the topology parameter and overrides the
        topology specified in MAX. Note: When initializing an NI SwitchBlock
        device with topology, you must specify the toplogy created when you
        configured the device in MAX, using either
        NISWITCH_TOPOLOGY_CONFIGURED_TOPOLOGY or the toplogy string of the
        device. Refer to the Initializing with Toplogy for NI SwitchBlock
        Devices topic in the NI Switches Help for information about determining
        the topology string of an NI SwitchBlock device. By default, the switch
        is reset to a known state. Enable simulation by specifying the topology
        and setting the simulate parameter to True.

        Args:
            resource_name (str): Resource name of the switch module to initialize. Default value: None

                MAX Under Valid Syntax Devices and Interfaces DeviceName Traditional

                number]::device number TIP: IVI logical names are also valid for the
                resource name. Default values for optional fields: chassis ID = 1 bus
                number = 0 Example resource names: Resource Name Description SC1Mod3

            topology (str): Pass the topology name you want to use for the switch you specify with
                Resource Name parameter. You can also pass
                NISWITCH_TOPOLOGY_CONFIGURED_TOPOLOGY to use the last topology that
                was configured for the device in MAX. Default Value:

        r'''_init_with_topology

        Returns a session handle used to identify the switch in all subsequent
        instrument driver calls and sets the topology of the switch.
        __init__ creates a new IVI instrument driver session
        for the switch specified in the resourceName parameter. The driver uses
        the topology specified in the topology parameter and overrides the
        topology specified in MAX. Note: When initializing an NI SwitchBlock
        device with topology, you must specify the toplogy created when you
        configured the device in MAX, using either
        NISWITCH_TOPOLOGY_CONFIGURED_TOPOLOGY or the toplogy string of the
        device. Refer to the Initializing with Toplogy for NI SwitchBlock
        Devices topic in the NI Switches Help for information about determining
        the topology string of an NI SwitchBlock device. By default, the switch
        is reset to a known state. Enable simulation by specifying the topology
        and setting the simulate parameter to True.

        Args:
            resource_name (str): Resource name of the switch module to initialize. Default value: None
