    def _get_error(self, error_description_size=[1024]):
        r'''_get_error

        Get error information of the first error that occurred. If a valid
        pointer is passed to errorDescription or errorNumber, GetError will
        clear the error on completion. errorDescriptionSize is an in/out
        parameter that describes the size of the errorDescription buffer. On the
        way in, it tells the method the size of string. On the way out, it
        describes the number of bytes (including the trailing null string)
        needed to hold the entire error description buffer. If NULL is passed
        for errorDescription and the errorNumber, the method will not clear
        the error. Users wanting to dynamically size the errorDescription string
        can thus call the method twice. On the first call they can pass NULL
        for the errorDescription and use the returned errorDescriptionSize to
        allocate enough space for the entire errorDescription buffer. Note that
        if a buffer is passed that is not large enough to hold the entire
        description string, the portion of of the string that will fit in the
        passed buffer will be returned and the error will still be cleared. All
        of the parameters are NULL tolerant. Note that passing NULL for both
        errorNumber and errorDescription can change the method's behavior.

        Args:
            error_description_size (list of int): As input, it is the size of the error description string buffer. As
                output, it is the Size of the entire error description string (may be
                larger than the buffer size as the method always returns the size
                needed to hold the entire buffer). This parameter is a ViInt32 that is
                passed by reference into the method. As an input, it is the size of
                the error description buffer being passed. If the error description
                string is larger than the string buffer being passed, only the portion
                of the route string that can fit in the string buffer will be copied
                into it. On return from the method, it holds the size required to hold
                the entire error description string, including the NULL termination
                character. Note that this size may be larger than the buffer size as the
                method always returns the size needed to hold the entire buffer. You
                may pass NULL for this parameter if you are not interested in the return
                value for it.


        Returns:
            error_number (int): By reference parameter which returns the error number of the first error
                which occurred on the session since the error was last cleared. You may
                pass NULL for this parameter if you are not interested in the return
                value.

            error_description (str): By reference buffer which is to be filled with the error description
                string. You may pass NULL for this parameter if you are not interested
                in the return value. To obtain the error description string, you should
                pass a buffer to this parameter. The size of the buffer required may be
                obtained by calling the method with NULL for this parameter and a
                valid ViInt32 to the error description size parameter. The error
                description size will contain the size needed to hold the entire route
                specification (including the NULL termination character). Common
                operation is to call the method twice. The first time you call the
                method you can determine the size needed to hold the route
                specification string. Allocate a buffer of the appropriate size and then
                re-call the method to obtain the entire buffer.

        specified NI Switch Executive virtual device. Returns a session handle
        that you use to identify the virtual device in all subsequent NI Switch
        Executive method calls. NI Switch Executive uses a reference counting
        scheme to manage open session handles to an NI Switch Executive virtual
        device. Each call to __init__ must be matched with a subsequent
        call to close. Successive calls to __init__ with
        the same virtual device name always returns the same session handle. NI
        Switch Executive disconnects its communication with the IVI switches
        after all session handles are closed to a given virtual device. The
        session handles may be used safely in multiple threads of an
        application. Sessions may only be opened to a given NI Switch Executive
        virtual device from a single process at a time.

                { 'simulate': False }

                You do not have to specify a value for all the properties. If you do not
                specify a value for a property, the default value is used.

        multiconnection mode. In the event of an error, the call to
        connect will attempt to undo any connections made so that the

        made. Some errors can be caught before manipulating hardware, although
        it is feasible that a hardware call could fail causing some connections
        to be momentarily closed and then reopened. If the wait for debounce
        parameter is set, the method will not return until the switch system
        has debounced.

        Args:
            connect_spec (str): String describing the connections to be made. The route specification
                strings are best summarized as a series of routes delimited by
                ampersands. The specified routes may be route names, route group names,
                or fully specified route paths delimited by square brackets. Some

                before they can be reconnected. Calling Connect on a route that was
                connected using No Multiconnect mode results in an error condition.
                NISE_VAL_MULTICONNECT_ROUTES (1)- routes specified in the connection
                specification can be connected multiple times. The first call to Connect
                performs the physical hardware connection. Successive calls to Connect
                increase a connection reference count. Similarly, calls to Disconnect

        Connects routes and disconnects routes in a similar fashion to
        connect and disconnect except that the operations happen in
        the context of a single method call. This method is useful for
        switching from one state to another state. connect_and_disconnect
        manipulates the hardware connections and disconnections only when the
        routes are different between the connection and disconnection
        specifications. If any routes are common between the connection and
        disconnection specifications, NI Switch Executive determines whether or
        not the relays need to be switched. This functionality has the distinct
        advantage of increased throughput for shared connections, because
        hardware does not have to be involved and potentially increases relay
        lifetime by decreasing the number of times that the relay has to be
        switched. In the event of an error, the call to
        connect_and_disconnect attempts to undo any connections made, but
        does not attempt to reconnect disconnections. Some errors can be caught

            operation_order (enums.OperationOrder): Sets the order of the operation for the method. Defined values are
                Break Before Make and Break After Make. OperationOrder.BEFORE
                (1) - The method disconnects the routes specified in the disconnect
                specification before connecting the routes specified in the connect
                specification. This is the typical mode of operation.
                OperationOrder.AFTER (2) - The method connects the routes
                specified in the connection specification before connecting the routes
                specified in the disconnection specification. This mode of operation is
                normally used when you are switching current and want to ensure that a
                load is always connected to your source. The order of operation is to
                connect first or disconnect first.

            wait_for_debounce (bool): Waits (if true) for switches to debounce between its connect and
                disconnect operations. If false, it immediately begins the second
                operation after completing the first. The order of connect and
                disconnect operation is set by the Operation Order input.

        r'''disconnect

        Disconnects the routes specified in the Disconnection Specification. If
        any of the specified routes were originally connected in a
        multiconnected mode, the call to disconnect reduces the reference
        count on the route by 1. If the reference count reaches 0, it is
        disconnected. If a specified route does not exist, it is an error
        condition. In the event of an error, the call to disconnect
        continues to try to disconnect everything specified by the route
        specification string but reports the error on completion.

        Args:
            disconnect_spec (str): String describing the disconnections to be made. The route specification

        connect_and_disconnect) that use route specification strings.

        Args:
            route_spec (str): String describing the routes and route groups to expand. The route
                specification strings are best summarized as a series of routes
                delimited by ampersands. The specified routes may be route names, route
                group names, or fully specified route paths delimited by square

                MyRouteGroup & [A->Switch1/r0->B] Refer to Route Specification Strings
                in the NI Switch Executive Help for more information.

            expand_action (enums.ExpandAction): This value sets the expand action for the method. The action might be
                one of the following: ExpandAction.ROUTES (0) - expands the
                route spec to routes. Converts route groups to their constituent routes.
                ExpandAction.PATHS (1) - expands the route spec to paths.
                Converts routes and route groups to their constituent square bracket
                route spec strings. Example: [Dev1/c0->Dev1/r0->Dev1/c1]

            expanded_route_spec_size (list of int): The routeSpecSize is an ViInt32 that is passed by reference into the
                method. As an input, it is the size of the route spec string buffer
                being passed. If the route spec string is larger than the string buffer
                being passed, only the portion of the route spec string that can fit in
                the string buffer is copied into it. On return from the method,
                routeSpecSize holds the size required to hold the entire route spec
                string. Note that this size may be larger than the buffer size as the
                method always returns the size needed to hold the entire buffer. You
                may pass NULL for this parameter if you are not interested in the return
                value for routeSpecSize and routeSpec.


        Returns:
            expanded_route_spec (str): The expanded route spec. Route specification strings can be directly
                passed to connect, disconnect, or connect_and_disconnect
                Refer to Route Specification Strings in the NI Switch Executive Help for
                more information. You may pass NULL for this parameter if you are not
                interested in the return value. To obtain the route specification
                string, you should pass a buffer to this parameter. The size of the
                buffer required may be obtained by calling the method with NULL for
                this parameter and a valid ViInt32 to routeSpecSize. The routeSpecSize
                will contain the size needed to hold the entire route specification
                (including the NULL termination character). Common operation is to call
                the method twice. The first time you call the method you can
                determine the size needed to hold the route specification string.
                Allocate a buffer of the appropriate size and then re-call the method
                to obtain the entire buffer.

                following: Path Available (1) A path between channel 1 and channel 2 is
                available. The route specification parameter returns a string describing
                the available path. Path Exists (2) A path between channel 1 and channel
                2 already exists. The route specification parameter returns a string
                describing the existing path. Path Unsupported (3) There is no potential
                path between channel 1 and channel 2 given the current configuration.
                Resource In Use (4) There is a potential path between channel 1 and
                channel 2, although a resource needed to complete the path is already in
                use. Source Conflict (5) Channel 1 and channel 2 cannot be connected
                because their connection would result in an exclusion violation. Channel
                Not Available (6) One of the channels is not useable as an endpoint
                channel. Make sure that it is not marked as a reserved for routing.
                Channels Hardwired (7) The two channels reside on the same hardwire. An
                implicit path already exists.

            virtual_device_name (str): The name of the NI Switch Executive virtual device.

            option_string (dict): The option string can be used to pass information to each of the IVI
                devices on startup. It can be used to set things such as simulation,
                range checking, etc. Consult your driver documentation for more
                information about valid entries for the option string.


        Returns:
            vi (int): The session referencing this NI Switch Executive virtual device session.

        r'''wait_for_debounce

        Waits for all of the switches in the NI Switch Executive virtual device
        to debounce. This method does not return until either the switching
        system is completely debounced and settled or the maximum time has
        elapsed and the system is not yet debounced. In the event that the
        maximum time elapses, the method returns an error indicating that a
        timeout has occurred. To ensure that all of the switches have settled,
        NI recommends calling wait_for_debounce after a series of connection
        or disconnection operations and before taking any measurements of the
        signals connected to the switching system.

        Args:
            maximum_time_ms (hightime.timedelta, datetime.timedelta, or int in milliseconds): The amount of time to wait (in milliseconds) for the debounce to
                complete. A value of 0 checks for debouncing once and returns an error
                if the system is not debounced at that time. A value of -1 means to
                block for an infinite period of time until the system is debounced.
