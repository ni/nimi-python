        This method queries the value of an NI-TClk ViString property. You
        must provide a ViChar array to serve as a buffer for the value. You pass
        the number of bytes in the buffer as bufSize. If the current value of
        the property, including the terminating NULL byte, is larger than the
        size you indicate in bufSize, the method copies bufSize minus 1 bytes
        into the buffer, places an ASCII NULL byte at the end of the buffer, and
        returns the array size that you must pass to get the entire value. For
        example, if the value is "123456" and bufSize is 4, the method places
        "123" into the buffer and returns 7. If you want to call
        _get_attribute_vi_string just to get the required array size, pass 0
        for bufSize and VI_NULL for the value.

    def configure_for_homogeneous_triggers(self, sessions):
        r'''configure_for_homogeneous_triggers

        Configures the properties commonly required for the TClk synchronization
        of device sessions with homogeneous triggers in a single PXI chassis or
        a single PC. Use configure_for_homogeneous_triggers to configure
        the properties for the reference clocks, start triggers, reference
        triggers, script triggers, and pause triggers. If
        configure_for_homogeneous_triggers cannot perform all the steps
        appropriate for the given sessions, it returns an error. If an error is
        returned, use the instrument driver methods and properties for signal
        routing, along with the following NI-TClk properties:
        start_trigger_master_session
        ref_trigger_master_session
        script_trigger_master_session
        pause_trigger_master_session
        configure_for_homogeneous_triggers affects the following clocks and
        triggers: - Reference clocks - Start triggers - Reference triggers -
        Script triggers - Pause triggers Reference Clocks
        configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures the reference clocks
        if they are needed. Specifically, if the internal sample clocks or
        internal sample clock timebases are used, and the reference clock source
        is not configured--or is set to None (no trigger
        configured)--configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures the
        following: PXI--The reference clock source on all devices is set to be
        the 10 MHz PXI backplane clock (PXI_CLK10). PCI--One of the devices
        exports its 10 MHz onboard reference clock to RTSI 7. The reference
        clock source on all devices is set to be RTSI 7. Note: If the reference
        clock source is set to a value other than None,
        configure_for_homogeneous_triggers cannot configure the reference
        clock source. Start Triggers If the start trigger is set to None (no
        trigger configured) for all sessions, the sessions are configured to
        share the start trigger. The start trigger is shared by: - Implicitly
        exporting the start trigger from one session - Configuring the other
        sessions for digital edge start triggers with sources corresponding to
        the exported start trigger - Setting
        start_trigger_master_session to the session that is
        exporting the trigger for all sessions If the start triggers are None
        for all except one session, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers
        configures the sessions to share the start trigger from the one excepted
        session. The start trigger is shared by: - Implicitly exporting start
        trigger from the session with the start trigger that is not None -
        Configuring the other sessions for digital-edge start triggers with
        sources corresponding to the exported start trigger - Setting
        start_trigger_master_session to the session that is
        exporting the trigger for all sessions If start triggers are configured
        for all sessions, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers does not
        affect the start triggers. Start triggers are considered to be
        configured for all sessions if either of the following conditions is
        true: - No session has a start trigger that is None - One session has a
        start trigger that is None, and all other sessions have start triggers
        other than None. The one session with the None trigger must have
        start_trigger_master_session set to itself, indicating
        that the session itself is the start trigger master Reference Triggers
        configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures sessions that support
        reference triggers to share the reference triggers if the reference
        triggers are None (no trigger configured) for all except one session.
        The reference triggers are shared by: - Implicitly exporting the
        reference trigger from the session whose reference trigger is not None -
        Configuring the other sessions that support the reference trigger for
        digital-edge reference triggers with sources corresponding to the
        exported reference trigger - Setting
        ref_trigger_master_session to the session that is
        exporting the trigger for all sessions that support reference trigger If
        the reference triggers are configured for all sessions that support
        reference triggers, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers does not
        affect the reference triggers. Reference triggers are considered to be
        configured for all sessions if either one or the other of the following
        conditions is true: - No session has a reference trigger that is None -
        One session has a reference trigger that is None, and all other sessions
        have reference triggers other than None. The one session with the None
        trigger must have ref_trigger_master_session set to
        itself, indicating that the session itself is the reference trigger
        master Reference Trigger Holdoffs Acquisition sessions may be configured
        with the reference trigger. For acquisition sessions, when the reference
        trigger is shared, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures
        the holdoff properties (which are instrument driver specific) on the
        reference trigger master session so that the session does not recognize
        the reference trigger before the other sessions are ready. This
        condition is only relevant when the sample clock rates, sample clock
        timebase rates, sample counts, holdoffs, and/or any delays for the
        acquisitions are different. When the sample clock rates, sample clock
        timebase rates, and/or the sample counts are different in acquisition
        sessions sharing the reference trigger, you should also set the holdoff
        properties for the reference trigger master using the instrument driver.
        Script Triggers configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures
        sessions that support script triggers to share them, if the script
        triggers are None (no trigger configured) for all except one session.
        The script triggers are shared in the following ways: - Implicitly
        exporting the script trigger from the session whose script trigger is
        not None - Configuring the other sessions that support the script
        trigger for digital-edge script triggers with sources corresponding to
        the exported script trigger - Setting
        script_trigger_master_session to the session that is
        exporting the trigger for all sessions that support script triggers If
        the script triggers are configured for all sessions that support script
        triggers, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers does not affect script
        triggers. Script triggers are considered to be configured for all
        sessions if either one or the other of the following conditions are
        true: - No session has a script trigger that is None - One session has a
        script trigger that is None and all other sessions have script triggers
        other than None. The one session with the None trigger must have
        script_trigger_master_session set to itself, indicating
        that the session itself is the script trigger master Pause Triggers
        configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures generation sessions
        that support pause triggers to share them, if the pause triggers are
        None (no trigger configured) for all except one session. The pause
        triggers are shared by: - Implicitly exporting the pause trigger from
        the session whose script trigger is not None - Configuring the other
        sessions that support the pause trigger for digital-edge pause triggers
        with sources corresponding to the exported pause trigger - Setting
        pause_trigger_master_session to the session that is
        exporting the trigger for all sessions that support script triggers If
        the pause triggers are configured for all generation sessions that
        support pause triggers, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers does not
        affect pause triggers. Pause triggers are considered to be configured
        for all sessions if either one or the other of the following conditions
        is true: - No session has a pause trigger that is None - One session has
        a pause trigger that is None and all other sessions have pause triggers
        other than None. The one session with the None trigger must have
        pause_trigger_master_session set to itself, indicating

    trigger from the session with the start trigger that is not None -
    Configuring the other sessions for digital-edge start triggers with
    sources corresponding to the exported start trigger - Setting
    start_trigger_master_session to the session that is
    exporting the trigger for all sessions If start triggers are configured
    for all sessions, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers does not
    affect the start triggers. Start triggers are considered to be
    configured for all sessions if either of the following conditions is
    true: - No session has a start trigger that is None - One session has a
    start trigger that is None, and all other sessions have start triggers
    other than None. The one session with the None trigger must have
    start_trigger_master_session set to itself, indicating
    that the session itself is the start trigger master Reference Triggers
    configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures sessions that support
    reference triggers to share the reference triggers if the reference
    triggers are None (no trigger configured) for all except one session.
    The reference triggers are shared by: - Implicitly exporting the
    reference trigger from the session whose reference trigger is not None -
    Configuring the other sessions that support the reference trigger for
    digital-edge reference triggers with sources corresponding to the
    exported reference trigger - Setting
    ref_trigger_master_session to the session that is
    exporting the trigger for all sessions that support reference trigger If
    the reference triggers are configured for all sessions that support
    reference triggers, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers does not
    affect the reference triggers. Reference triggers are considered to be
    configured for all sessions if either one or the other of the following
    conditions is true: - No session has a reference trigger that is None -
    One session has a reference trigger that is None, and all other sessions
    have reference triggers other than None. The one session with the None
    trigger must have ref_trigger_master_session set to
    itself, indicating that the session itself is the reference trigger
    master Reference Trigger Holdoffs Acquisition sessions may be configured
    with the reference trigger. For acquisition sessions, when the reference
    trigger is shared, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures
    the holdoff properties (which are instrument driver specific) on the
    reference trigger master session so that the session does not recognize
    the reference trigger before the other sessions are ready. This
    condition is only relevant when the sample clock rates, sample clock
    timebase rates, sample counts, holdoffs, and/or any delays for the
    acquisitions are different. When the sample clock rates, sample clock
    timebase rates, and/or the sample counts are different in acquisition
    sessions sharing the reference trigger, you should also set the holdoff
    properties for the reference trigger master using the instrument driver.
    Script Triggers configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures
    sessions that support script triggers to share them, if the script
    triggers are None (no trigger configured) for all except one session.
    The script triggers are shared in the following ways: - Implicitly
    exporting the script trigger from the session whose script trigger is
    not None - Configuring the other sessions that support the script
    trigger for digital-edge script triggers with sources corresponding to
    the exported script trigger - Setting
    script_trigger_master_session to the session that is
    exporting the trigger for all sessions that support script triggers If
    the script triggers are configured for all sessions that support script
    triggers, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers does not affect script
    triggers. Script triggers are considered to be configured for all
    sessions if either one or the other of the following conditions are
    true: - No session has a script trigger that is None - One session has a
    script trigger that is None and all other sessions have script triggers
    other than None. The one session with the None trigger must have
    script_trigger_master_session set to itself, indicating
    that the session itself is the script trigger master Pause Triggers
    configure_for_homogeneous_triggers configures generation sessions
    that support pause triggers to share them, if the pause triggers are
    None (no trigger configured) for all except one session. The pause
    triggers are shared by: - Implicitly exporting the pause trigger from
    the session whose script trigger is not None - Configuring the other
    sessions that support the pause trigger for digital-edge pause triggers
    with sources corresponding to the exported pause trigger - Setting
    pause_trigger_master_session to the session that is
    exporting the trigger for all sessions that support script triggers If
    the pause triggers are configured for all generation sessions that
    support pause triggers, configure_for_homogeneous_triggers does not
    affect pause triggers. Pause triggers are considered to be configured
    for all sessions if either one or the other of the following conditions
    is true: - No session has a pause trigger that is None - One session has
    a pause trigger that is None and all other sessions have pause triggers
    other than None. The one session with the None trigger must have
    pause_trigger_master_session set to itself, indicating
    that the session itself is the pause trigger master Note: TClk
    synchronization is not supported for pause triggers on acquisition
    sessions.

    returns control to the calling program if the operation completes
    successfully or an error occurs (including a timeout error). This
    method is most useful for finite data operations that you expect to
