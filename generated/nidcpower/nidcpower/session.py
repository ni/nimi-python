    def self_cal(self):
        r'''self_cal

        Performs a self-calibration upon the specified channel(s).

        This method disables the output, performs several internal
        calculations, and updates calibration values. The updated calibration
        values are written to the device hardware if the
        self_calibration_persistence property is set to
        SelfCalibrationPersistence.WRITE_TO_EEPROM. Refer to the
        self_calibration_persistence property topic for more
        information about the settings for this property.

        When calling self_cal with the PXIe-4162/4163,
        specify all channels of your PXIe-4162/4163 with the channelName input.
        You cannot self-calibrate a subset of PXIe-4162/4163 channels.

        Refer to the

        create_advanced_sequence_step method to add steps to the
        active advanced sequence.

        You can create multiple advanced sequences in a session.

        **Support for this method**

        You must set the source mode to Sequence to use this method.

        Using the set_sequence method with Advanced Sequence
        methods is unsupported.

        Use this method in the Uncommitted or Committed programming states.
        Refer to the `Programming
        States <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(programmingstates)>`__ topic in
        the *NI DC Power Supplies and SMUs Help* for more information about
        NI-DCPower programming states.

        Tip:
        This method can be called on specific channels within your :py:class:`nidcpower.Session` instance.
        Use Python index notation on the repeated capabilities container channels to specify a subset,
        and then call this method on the result.

        Example: :py:meth:`my_session.channels[ ... ].create_advanced_sequence`

        To call the method on all channels, you can call it directly on the :py:class:`nidcpower.Session`.

        Example: :py:meth:`my_session.create_advanced_sequence`

        Args:
            sequence_name (str): Specifies the name of the sequence to create.

            property_names (list of str): Specifies the names of the properties you reconfigure per step in the advanced sequence. The following table lists which properties can be configured in an advanced sequence for each NI-DCPower device that supports advanced sequencing. A Yes indicates that the property can be configured in advanced sequencing. An No indicates that the property cannot be configured in advanced sequencing.

        Returns a list of named tuples (Measurement) that were
        previously taken and are stored in the NI-DCPower buffer. This method
        should not be used when the measure_when property is
        set to MeasureWhen.ON_DEMAND. You must first call
        initiate before calling this method.

        Fields in Measurement:

        This method is not supported on all devices. For more information about supported devices, search ni.com for Supported Methods by Device.

        Tip:
        This method can be called on specific channels within your :py:class:`nidcpower.Session` instance.
        Use Python index notation on the repeated capabilities container channels to specify a subset,
        and then call this method on the result.

        Example: :py:meth:`my_session.channels[ ... ].fetch_multiple`

        To call the method on all channels, you can call it directly on the :py:class:`nidcpower.Session`.

        Example: :py:meth:`my_session.fetch_multiple`

            timeout (hightime.timedelta, datetime.timedelta, or float in seconds): Specifies the maximum time allowed for this method to complete. If the method does not complete within this time interval, NI-DCPower returns an error.
                Default value: 1.0 second

                Note: When setting the timeout interval, ensure you take into account any triggers so that the timeout interval is long enough for your application.

        Returns an array of voltage measurements, an array of current
        measurements, and an array of compliance measurements that were
        previously taken and are stored in the NI-DCPower buffer. This method
        should not be used when the measure_when property is
        set to MeasureWhen.ON_DEMAND. You must first call
        initiate before calling this method.

        Refer to the `Acquiring
        Measurements <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(acquiringmeasurements)>`__
        and `Compliance <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(compliance)>`__ topics in
        the *NI DC Power Supplies and SMUs Help* for more information about
        configuring this method.

        Note:
        This method is not supported on all devices. For more information about supported devices, search ni.com for Supported Methods by Device.

        Tip:
        This method can be called on specific channels within your :py:class:`nidcpower.Session` instance.
        Use Python index notation on the repeated capabilities container channels to specify a subset,
        and then call this method on the result.

        Example: :py:meth:`my_session.channels[ ... ]._fetch_multiple`

        To call the method on all channels, you can call it directly on the :py:class:`nidcpower.Session`.

        Example: :py:meth:`my_session._fetch_multiple`

        Args:
            timeout (hightime.timedelta, datetime.timedelta, or float in seconds): Specifies the maximum time allowed for this method to complete, in
                seconds. If the method does not complete within this time interval,
                NI-DCPower returns an error.

                Note:
                When setting the timeout interval, ensure you take into account any
                triggers so that the timeout interval is long enough for your
                application.

            count (int): Specifies the number of measurements to fetch.


        Returns:
            voltage_measurements (array.array("d")): Returns an array of voltage measurements. Ensure that sufficient space
                has been allocated for the returned array.

            current_measurements (array.array("d")): Returns an array of current measurements. Ensure that sufficient space
                has been allocated for the returned array.

            in_compliance (list of bool): Returns an array of Boolean values indicating whether the output was in
                compliance at the time the measurement was taken. Ensure that sufficient
                space has been allocated for the returned array.

                If the current value of the property, including the terminating NUL
                byte, contains more bytes that you indicate in this property, the
                method copies (buffer size -1) bytes into the buffer, places an ASCII
                NUL byte at the end of the buffer, and returns the buffer size you must
                pass to get the entire value. For example, if the value is 123456 and
                the buffer size is 4, the method places 123 into the buffer and
                returns 7.

    def lock(self):
        '''lock

        Obtains a multithread lock on the device session. Before doing so, the
        software waits until all other execution threads release their locks
        on the device session.

        Other threads may have obtained a lock on this session for the
        following reasons:

            -  The application called the lock method.
            -  A call to NI-DCPower locked the session.
            -  After a call to the lock method returns
               successfully, no other threads can access the device session until
               you call the unlock method or exit out of the with block when using
               lock context manager.
            -  Use the lock method and the
               unlock method around a sequence of calls to
               instrument driver methods if you require that the device retain its
               settings through the end of the sequence.

        You can safely make nested calls to the lock method
        within the same thread. To completely unlock the session, you must
        balance each call to the lock method with a call to
        the unlock method.

        Returns:
            lock (context manager): When used in a with statement, nidcpower.Session.lock acts as
            a context manager and unlock will be called when the with block is exited

                -  In the method panel window, click on the control or press **Enter**
                   or the spacebar to display a dialog box containing hierarchical list
                   of the available properties. Properties whose value cannot be set are
                   dim. Help text is shown for each property. Select a property by
                   double-clicking on it or by selecting it and then pressing **Enter**.
                -  Read-only properties appear dim in the list box. If you select a
                   read-only property, an error message appears. A ring control at the
                   top of the dialog box allows you to see all IVI properties or only
                   the properties of type ViString. If you choose to see all IVI
                   properties, the data types appear to the right of the property names
                   in the list box. Properties with data types other than ViString are
                   dim. If you select a property data type that is dim, LabWindows/CVI
                   transfers you to the method panel for the corresponding method
                   that is consistent with the data type.
                -  If you want to enter a variable name, press **Ctrl**\ +\ **T** to
                   change this ring control to a manual input box. If the property in
                   this ring control has named constants as valid values, you can view
                   the constants by moving to the value control and pressing **Enter**.

            attribute_value (str): Specifies the value to which you want to set the property. If the
                property currently showing in the property ring control has constants
                as valid values, you can view a list of the constants by pressing
                **Enter** on this control. Select a value by double-clicking on it or by
                selecting it and then pressing **Enter**.

                Note:
                Some of the values might not be valid depending upon the current
                settings of the device session.

        r'''An NI-DCPower session to an NI programmable power supply or source measure unit.

        Creates and returns a new NI-DCPower session to the instrument(s) and channel(s) specified
        in **resource name** to be used in all subsequent NI-DCPower method calls. With this method,
        you can optionally set the initial state of the following session properties:

        -  simulate
        -  driver_setup

        After calling this method, the specified channel or channels will be in the Uncommitted
        state.

        To place channel(s) in a known start-up state when creating a new session, set **reset** to
        True. This action is equivalent to using the reset method immediately after initializing the
        session.

        To open a session and leave the channel(s) in an existing configuration without passing
        through a transitional output state, set **reset** to False. Next, configure the channel(s)
        as in the previous session, change the desired settings, and then call the initiate method
        to write both settings.

        **Details of Independent Channel Operation**

        With this method and channel-based NI-DCPower methods and properties, you can use any
        channels in the session independently. For example, you can initiate a subset of channels in
        the session with initiate, and the other channels in the session remain in the Uncommitted
        state.

        When you initialize with independent channels, each channel steps through the NI-DCPower
        programming state model independently of all other channels, and you can specify a subset of
        channels for most operations.

        **Note** You can make concurrent calls to a session from multiple threads, but the session
        executes the calls one at a time. If you specify multiple channels for a method or property,
        the session may perform the operation on multiple channels in parallel, though this is not
        guaranteed, and some operations may execute sequentially.

        Args:
            resource_name (str, list, tuple): Specifies the **resource name** as seen in Measurement
                & Automation Explorer (MAX) or lsni, for example "PXI1Slot3" where "PXI1Slot3" is an
                instrument's **resource name**. If independent_channels is False, **resource name**
                can also be a logical IVI name.

                If independent_channels is True, **resource name** can be names of the instrument(s)
                and the channel(s) to initialize. Specify the instrument(s) and channel(s) using the
                form "PXI1Slot3/0,PXI1Slot3/2-3,PXI1Slot4/2-3 or
                PXI1Slot3/0,PXI1Slot3/2:3,PXI1Slot4/2:3", where "PXI1Slot3" and "PXI1Slot4" are
                instrument resource names followed by channels. If you exclude a channels string
                after an instrument resource name, all channels of the instrument(s) are included in
                the session.

            channels (str, list, range, tuple): For new applications, use the default value of None
                and specify the channels in **resource name**.

                Specifies which output channel(s) to include in a new session. Specify multiple
                channels by using a channel list or a channel range. A channel list is a comma (,)
                separated sequence of channel names (for example, 0,2 specifies channels 0 and 2).
                A channel range is a lower bound channel followed by a hyphen (-) or colon (:)
                followed by an upper bound channel (for example, 0-2 specifies channels 0, 1,
                and 2).

                If independent_channels is False, this argument specifies which channels to include
                in a legacy synchronized channels session. If you do not specify any channels, by
                default all channels on the device are included in the session.

                If independent_channels is True, this argument combines with **resource name** to
                specify which channels to include in an independent channels session. Initializing
                an independent channels session with a channels argument is deprecated.

            reset (bool): Specifies whether to reset channel(s) during the initialization procedure.

            options (dict): Specifies the initial value of certain properties for the session. The
                syntax for **options** is a dictionary of properties with an assigned
                value. For example:

                { 'simulate': False }

                You do not have to specify a value for all the properties. If you do not
                specify a value for a property, the default value is used.

                Advanced Example:
                { 'simulate': True, 'driver_setup': { 'Model': '<model number>',  'BoardType': '<type>' } }

                +-------------------------+---------+

            independent_channels (bool): Specifies whether to initialize the session with
                independent channels. Set this argument to False on legacy applications or if you

        You can export and import session property configurations only between
        devices with identical model numbers and the same number of configured
        channels.

        This method verifies that the properties you have configured for the
        session are valid. If the configuration is invalid, NI‑DCPower returns
        an error.

        **Support for this Method**

        Calling this method in `Sequence Source
        Mode <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(sequencing)>`__ is unsupported.

        **Channel Mapping Behavior for Multichannel Sessions**

        When importing and exporting session property configurations between
        NI‑DCPower sessions that were initialized with different channels, the
        configurations of the exporting channels are mapped to the importing
        channels in the order you specify in the **channelName** input to the
        __init__ method.

        For example, if your entry for **channelName** is 0,1 for the exporting
        session and 1,2 for the importing session:

        -  The configuration exported from channel 0 is imported into channel 1.
        -  The configuration exported from channel 1 is imported into channel 2.

        Exports the property configuration of the session to the specified
        file.

        You can export and import session property configurations only between
        devices with identical model numbers and the same number of configured
        channels.

        This method verifies that the properties you have configured for the
        session are valid. If the configuration is invalid, NI‑DCPower returns
        an error.

        **Support for this Method**

        Calling this method in `Sequence Source
        Mode <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(sequencing)>`__ is unsupported.

        **Channel Mapping Behavior for Multichannel Sessions**

        When importing and exporting session property configurations between
        NI‑DCPower sessions that were initialized with different channels, the
        configurations of the exporting channels are mapped to the importing
        channels in the order you specify in the **channelName** input to the
        __init__ method.

        For example, if your entry for **channelName** is 0,1 for the exporting
        session and 1,2 for the importing session:

        -  The configuration exported from channel 0 is imported into channel 1.
        -  The configuration exported from channel 1 is imported into channel 2.

    def _fancy_initialize(self, resource_name, channels=None, reset=False, option_string="", independent_channels=True):
        '''_fancy_initialize

        Creates and returns a new NI-DCPower session to the instrument(s) and channel(s) specified
        in **resource name** to be used in all subsequent NI-DCPower method calls. With this method,
        you can optionally set the initial state of the following session properties:

        -  simulate
        -  driver_setup

        After calling this method, the specified channel or channels will be in the Uncommitted
        state.

        To place channel(s) in a known start-up state when creating a new session, set **reset** to
        True. This action is equivalent to using the reset method immediately after initializing the
        session.

        To open a session and leave the channel(s) in an existing configuration without passing
        through a transitional output state, set **reset** to False. Next, configure the channel(s)
        as in the previous session, change the desired settings, and then call the initiate method
        to write both settings.

        **Details of Independent Channel Operation**

        With this method and channel-based NI-DCPower methods and properties, you can use any
        channels in the session independently. For example, you can initiate a subset of channels in
        the session with initiate, and the other channels in the session remain in the Uncommitted
        state.

        When you initialize with independent channels, each channel steps through the NI-DCPower
        programming state model independently of all other channels, and you can specify a subset of
        channels for most operations.

        **Note** You can make concurrent calls to a session from multiple threads, but the session
        executes the calls one at a time. If you specify multiple channels for a method or property,
        the session may perform the operation on multiple channels in parallel, though this is not
        guaranteed, and some operations may execute sequentially.

        Args:
            resource_name (str, list, tuple): Specifies the **resource name** as seen in Measurement
                & Automation Explorer (MAX) or lsni, for example "PXI1Slot3" where "PXI1Slot3" is an
                instrument's **resource name**. If independent_channels is False, **resource name**
                can also be a logical IVI name.

                If independent_channels is True, **resource name** can be names of the instrument(s)
                and the channel(s) to initialize. Specify the instrument(s) and channel(s) using the
                form "PXI1Slot3/0,PXI1Slot3/2-3,PXI1Slot4/2-3 or
                PXI1Slot3/0,PXI1Slot3/2:3,PXI1Slot4/2:3", where "PXI1Slot3" and "PXI1Slot4" are
                instrument resource names followed by channels. If you exclude a channels string
                after an instrument resource name, all channels of the instrument(s) are included in
                the session.

            channels (str, list, range, tuple): For new applications, use the default value of None
                and specify the channels in **resource name**.

                Specifies which output channel(s) to include in a new session. Specify multiple
                channels by using a channel list or a channel range. A channel list is a comma (,)
                separated sequence of channel names (for example, 0,2 specifies channels 0 and 2).
                A channel range is a lower bound channel followed by a hyphen (-) or colon (:)
                followed by an upper bound channel (for example, 0-2 specifies channels 0, 1,
                and 2).

                If independent_channels is False, this argument specifies which channels to include
                in a legacy synchronized channels session. If you do not specify any channels, by
                default all channels on the device are included in the session.

                If independent_channels is True, this argument combines with **resource name** to
                specify which channels to include in an independent channels session. Initializing
                an independent channels session with a channels argument is deprecated.

            reset (bool): Specifies whether to reset channel(s) during the initialization procedure.

            option_string (dict): Specifies the initial value of certain properties for the session.
                The syntax for **optionString** is a list of properties with an assigned value where
                1 is True and 0 is False. For example:

                Simulate=0, DriverSetup=Model:<model number>; BoardType:<bus connector>

                To simulate a multi-instrument session when independent_channels is True, set
                Simulate to 1 and list multiple instruments for DriverSetup. For example:

                Simulate=1, DriverSetup=ResourceName:<instrument name>; Model:<model number>;
                BoardType:<bus connector> & ResourceName:<resource name>; Model:<model number>;
                BoardType:<bus connector>

                You do not have to specify a value for all the properties. If you do not specify a
                value for a property, the default value is used.

            independent_channels (bool): Specifies whether to initialize the session with
                independent channels. Set this argument to False on legacy applications or if you
                are unable to upgrade your NI-DCPower driver runtime to 20.6 or higher.


        Returns:
            vi (int): Returns a session handle that you use to identify the device in all
                subsequent NI-DCPower method calls.

        Args:
            resource_name (str): Specifies the **resourceName** assigned by Measurement & Automation
                Explorer (MAX), for example "PXI1Slot3" where "PXI1Slot3" is an
                instrument's **resourceName**. **resourceName** can also be a logical
                IVI name.

            channels (str): Specifies which output channel(s) to include in a new session. Specify
                multiple channels by using a channel list or a channel range. A channel
                list is a comma (,) separated sequence of channel names (for example,
                0,2 specifies channels 0 and 2). A channel range is a lower bound
                channel followed by a hyphen (-) or colon (:) followed by an upper bound
                channel (for example, 0-2 specifies channels 0, 1, and 2). In the
                Running state, multiple output channel configurations are performed
                sequentially based on the order specified in this parameter. If you do
                not specify any channels, by default all channels on the device are
                included in the session.

            reset (bool): Specifies whether to reset the device during the initialization
                procedure.

            option_string (str): Specifies the initial value of certain properties for the session.
                The syntax for **optionString** is a list of properties with an assigned
                value where 1 is True and 0 is False. For example:

                "Simulate=0"

                You do not have to specify a value for all the properties. If you do not
                specify a value for a property, the default value is used.

                Instrument <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(simulate)>`__.


        Returns:
            vi (int): Returns a session handle that you use to identify the device in all
                subsequent NI-DCPower method calls.

        '''
        vi = self._interpreter.initialize_with_channels(resource_name, channels, reset, option_string)

    def _initialize_with_independent_channels(self, resource_name, reset, option_string):
        r'''_initialize_with_independent_channels

        Creates a new NI-DCPower session to the specified instrument(s) and channel(s) and returns a
        session handle to be used in all subsequent NI-DCPower method calls.

        After calling this method, the specified channel or channels will be in the Uncommitted
        state.

        With this method and channel-based NI-DCPower methods and properties, you can use any
        channels in the session independently. For example, you can initiate a subset of channels in
        the session with initiate, and the other channels in the session
        remain in the Uncommitted state.

        **Details of Independent Channel Operation**

        When you initialize with independent channels, each channel steps through the NI-DCPower
        programming state model independently of all other channels, and you can specify a subset
        of channels for most operations.

        **Note** You can make concurrent calls to a session from multiple threads, but the session
        executes the calls one at a time. If you specify multiple channels for a method or
        property, the session may perform the operation on multiple channels in parallel, though
        this is not guaranteed, and some operations may execute sequentially.

        Args:
            resource_name (str): Specifies the NI-DCPower resources to use in the session.
                NI-DCPower resources can be names of the instrument(s) assigned by Measurement &
                Automation Explorer (MAX) and the channel(s) to initialize. Specify the
                instrument(s) and channel(s) using the form PXI1Slot3/0,PXI1Slot3/2-3,PXI1Slot4/2-3
                or PXI1Slot3/0,PXI1Slot3/2:3,PXI1Slot4/2:3, where PXI1Slot3 and PXI1Slot4 are
                instrument resource names and 0, 2, and 3 are channels.

                If you pass "" for this control, all channels of the instrument(s) are included in
                the session.

            reset (bool): Specifies whether to reset channel(s) during the initialization procedure.
                The default is False.

                To place channel(s) in a known startup state when creating a new session, set
                **reset** to True. This action is equivalent to using the reset
                method immediately after initializing the session.

                To open a session and leave the channel(s) in an existing configuration without
                passing through a transitional output state, set **reset** to False. Next, configure
                the channel(s) as in the previous session, change the desired settings, and then
                call the initiate method to write both settings.

            option_string (str): Specifies the initial value of certain properties for the session.
                The syntax for **optionString** is a list of properties with an assigned value where
                1 is True and 0 is False. For example:

                Simulate=0, DriverSetup=Model:<model number>; BoardType:<bus connector>

                To simulate a multi-instrument session, set Simulate to 1 and list multiple
                instruments for DriverSetup. For example:

                Simulate=1, DriverSetup=ResourceName:<instrument name>; Model:<model number>;
                BoardType:<bus connector> & ResourceName:<resource name>; Model:<model number>;
                BoardType:<bus connector>

                You do not have to specify a value for all the properties. If you do not specify a
                value for a property, the default value is used.

    def get_channel_names(self, indices):
        '''get_channel_names

        Returns a list of channel names for the given channel indices.

        Args:
            indices (basic sequence types or str or int): Index list for the channels in the session. Valid values are from zero to the total number of channels in the session minus one. The index string can be one of the following formats:

                -   A comma-separated list—for example, "0,2,3,1"
                -   A range using a hyphen—for example, "0-3"
                -   A range using a colon—for example, "0:3 "

                You can combine comma-separated lists and ranges that use a hyphen or colon. Both out-of-order and repeated indices are supported ("2,3,0," "1,2,2,3"). White space characters, including spaces, tabs, feeds, and carriage returns, are allowed between characters. Ranges can be incrementing or decrementing.


        Returns:
            names (list of str): The channel name(s) at the specified indices.

    def reset_device(self):
        r'''reset_device

        Resets the device to a known state. The method disables power
        generation, resets session properties to their default values, clears
        errors such as overtemperature and unexpected loss of auxiliary power,
        commits the session properties, and leaves the session in the
        Uncommitted state. This method also performs a hard reset on the
        device and driver software. This method has the same functionality as
        using reset in Measurement & Automation Explorer. Refer to the
        `Programming
        States <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(programmingstates)>`__ topic for
        more information about NI-DCPower software states.

        This will also open the output relay on devices that have an output
        relay.

        Note:
        NI-DCPower uses the terms "source" and "output". However, while sinking with electronic loads and SMUs these correspond to "sinking" and "input", respectively.

        Resets the device to a known state. This method disables power
        generation, resets session properties to their default values, commits
        the session properties, and leaves the session in the
        `Running <javascript:LaunchHelp('NI_DC_Power_Supplies_Help.chm::/programmingStates.html#running')>`__
        state. In addition to exhibiting the behavior of the reset
        method, this method can assign user-defined default values for
        configurable properties from the IVI configuration.

        self._interpreter.reset_with_defaults()

    def _close(self):
        r'''_close

        Closes the session specified in **vi** and deallocates the resources
        that NI-DCPower reserves. If power output is enabled when you call this
        method, the output channels remain in their existing state and
        continue providing power. Use the ConfigureOutputEnabled
        method to disable power output on a per channel basis. Use the
        reset method to disable power output on all channel(s).
