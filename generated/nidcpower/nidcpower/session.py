        Obtains a multithread lock on the device session. Before doing so, the
        software waits until all other execution threads release their locks
        on the device session.

        Other threads may have obtained a lock on this session for the
        following reasons:

            -  The application called the lock method.
            -  A call to NI-DCPower locked the session.
            -  After a call to the lock method returns
               successfully, no other threads can access the device session until
               you call the unlock method or exit out of the with block when using
               lock context manager.
            -  Use the lock method and the
               unlock method around a sequence of calls to
               instrument driver methods if you require that the device retain its
               settings through the end of the sequence.

        You can safely make nested calls to the lock method
        within the same thread. To completely unlock the session, you must
        balance each call to the lock method with a call to
        the unlock method.

        Returns:

        Returns arrays of the measured voltage and current values on the
        specified output channel(s). Each call to this method blocks other
        method calls until the measurements are returned from the device. The
        order of the measurements returned in the array corresponds to the order
        on the specified output channel(s).

        Tip:
        This method requires repeated capabilities. If called directly on the
        nidcpower.Session object, then the method will use all repeated capabilities in the session.
        You can specify a subset of repeated capabilities using the Python index notation on an
        nidcpower.Session repeated capabilities container, and calling this method on the result.

        Returns:
            voltage_measurements (array.array("d")): Returns an array of voltage measurements. The measurements in the array
                are returned in the same order as the channels specified in
                **channelName**. Ensure that sufficient space has been allocated for the
                returned array.

            current_measurements (array.array("d")): Returns an array of current measurements. The measurements in the array
                are returned in the same order as the channels specified in
                **channelName**. Ensure that sufficient space has been allocated for the

        r'''An NI-DCPower session to a National Instruments Programmable Power Supply or Source Measure Unit.

        Creates and returns a new NI-DCPower session to the power supply or SMU
        specified in **resource name** to be used in all subsequent NI-DCPower
        method calls. With this method, you can optionally set the initial
        state of the following session properties:

        -  simulate
        -  driver_setup

        After calling this method, the session will be in the Uncommitted
        state. Refer to the `Programming
        States <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(programmingstates)>`__ topic for
        details about specific software states.

        To place the device in a known start-up state when creating a new
        session, set **reset** to True. This action is equivalent to using
        the reset method immediately after initializing the
        session.

        To open a session and leave the device in its existing configuration
        without passing through a transitional output state, set **reset** to
        False. Then configure the device as in the previous session,
        changing only the desired settings, and then call the
        initiate method.

        **Related Topics:**

        `Programming
        States <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(programmingstates)>`__

        Args:
            resource_name (str): Specifies the **resourceName** assigned by Measurement & Automation
                Explorer (MAX), for example "PXI1Slot3" where "PXI1Slot3" is an
                instrument's **resourceName**. **resourceName** can also be a logical
                IVI name.

            channels (str, list, range, tuple): Specifies which output channel(s) to include in a new session. Specify
                multiple channels by using a channel list or a channel range. A channel
                list is a comma (,) separated sequence of channel names (for example,
                0,2 specifies channels 0 and 2). A channel range is a lower bound
                channel followed by a hyphen (-) or colon (:) followed by an upper bound
                channel (for example, 0-2 specifies channels 0, 1, and 2). In the
                Running state, multiple output channel configurations are performed
                sequentially based on the order specified in this parameter. If you do
                not specify any channels, by default all channels on the device are
                included in the session.

            reset (bool): Specifies whether to reset the device during the initialization
                procedure.

            options (dict): Specifies the initial value of certain properties for the session. The
                syntax for **options** is a dictionary of properties with an assigned
                value. For example:

                { 'simulate': False }

                You do not have to specify a value for all the properties. If you do not
                specify a value for a property, the default value is used.

                Advanced Example:
                { 'simulate': True, 'driver_setup': { 'Model': '<model number>',  'BoardType': '<type>' } }

    def abort(self):
        r'''abort

        Transitions the NI-DCPower session from the Running state to the
        Uncommitted state. If a sequence is running, it is stopped. Any
        configuration methods called after this method are not applied until
        the initiate method is called. If power output is enabled
        when you call the abort method, the output channels remain
        in their current state and continue providing power.

        Use the ConfigureOutputEnabled method to disable power
        output on a per channel basis. Use the reset method to
        disable output on all channels.

        Applies previously configured settings to the device. Calling this
        method moves the NI-DCPower session from the Uncommitted state into
        the Committed state. After calling this method, modifying any
        property reverts the NI-DCPower session to the Uncommitted state. Use

        r'''_create_advanced_sequence

        Creates an empty advanced sequence. Call the
        create_advanced_sequence_step method to add steps to the
        active advanced sequence.

        You can create multiple advanced sequences in a session.

        **Support for this method**

        You must set the source mode to Sequence to use this method.

        Using the set_sequence method with Advanced Sequence
        methods is unsupported.

        Use this method in the Uncommitted or Committed programming states.

        Exports the property configuration of the session to the specified
        configuration buffer.

        You can export and import session property configurations only between
        devices with identical model numbers and the same number of configured
        channels.

        This method verifies that the properties you have configured for the
        session are valid. If the configuration is invalid, NI‑DCPower returns
        an error.

        **Support for this Method**

        Calling this method in `Sequence Source
        Mode <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(sequencing)>`__ is unsupported.

        **Channel Mapping Behavior for Multichannel Sessions**

        When importing and exporting session property configurations between
        NI‑DCPower sessions that were initialized with different channels, the
        configurations of the exporting channels are mapped to the importing
        channels in the order you specify in the **channelName** input to the
        __init__ method.

        For example, if your entry for **channelName** is 0,1 for the exporting
        session and 1,2 for the importing session:

        -  The configuration exported from channel 0 is imported into channel 1.
        -  The configuration exported from channel 1 is imported into channel 2.

        Creates and returns a new NI-DCPower session to the power supply or SMU
        specified in **resource name** to be used in all subsequent NI-DCPower
        method calls. With this method, you can optionally set the initial
        state of the following session properties:

        -  simulate
        -  driver_setup

        After calling this method, the session will be in the Uncommitted
        state. Refer to the `Programming
        States <REPLACE_DRIVER_SPECIFIC_URL_1(programmingstates)>`__ topic for
        details about specific software states.

        To place the device in a known start-up state when creating a new
        session, set **reset** to True. This action is equivalent to using
        the reset method immediately after initializing the
        session.

        To open a session and leave the device in its existing configuration
        without passing through a transitional output state, set **reset** to
        False. Then configure the device as in the previous session,
        changing only the desired settings, and then call the
        initiate method.

        Args:

                Explorer (MAX), for example "PXI1Slot3" where "PXI1Slot3" is an
                instrument's **resourceName**. **resourceName** can also be a logical
                IVI name.

            channels (str, list, range, tuple): Specifies which output channel(s) to include in a new session. Specify
                multiple channels by using a channel list or a channel range. A channel
                list is a comma (,) separated sequence of channel names (for example,
                0,2 specifies channels 0 and 2). A channel range is a lower bound
                channel followed by a hyphen (-) or colon (:) followed by an upper bound
                channel (for example, 0-2 specifies channels 0, 1, and 2). In the
                Running state, multiple output channel configurations are performed
                sequentially based on the order specified in this parameter. If you do
                not specify any channels, by default all channels on the device are
                included in the session.

            reset (bool): Specifies whether to reset the device during the initialization
                procedure.

            option_string (dict): Specifies the initial value of certain properties for the session. The
                syntax for **optionString** is a list of properties with an assigned
                value where 1 is True and 0 is False. For example:

                "Simulate=0"

                You do not have to specify a value for all the properties. If you do not
                specify a value for a property, the default value is used.
