    * Modified how methods with repeated capabilities are invoked. There's no longer (for example) a `channel_name` input. Instead:
      ```python
      # Sets sequence on channels 0 through 3
      session['0-3'].set_sequence(values, source_delays)
      ```
    * Enum value documentation lists the fully qualified name - this is to allow easy copy/paste

    * Added default values to some parameters.
  * #### Removed
    * Removed methods that aren’t useful in the Python bindings.
* ### NI-SWITCH
  * #### Changed
    * Added default values to some parameters.

* ### NI-ModInst
  * #### Changed
    * Device index is now on session not attribute. The correct way is now
      ```python
      i = 0
      with nimodinst.Session('nidmm') as session:
          name = session[i].device_name
      ```
* ### NI-SWITCH
  * #### Added
    * Initial release
