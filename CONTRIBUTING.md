Getting Started
---------------

To contribute to this project, it is recommended that you follow these steps:

### System Requirements

In order to build **[nimi-python](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)**, you must have the
following installed:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - If you're on Windows 10 (not [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about))
        - Install the 64-bit Python version that is needed by `build_test` environment in [tox.ini](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python/blob/e13087eb67e2399de2dfa83fd504f8ebd0e0e263/tox.ini#L10)
        - [Ensure](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line) pip support is installed 
    - Add ``Python install path`` and ``python install path``\Scripts to Windows path
    - Copy ``Python install path``\python.exe to ``python install path``\python3.exe

* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    - If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux
        - Install and enable [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide)
        - Install make: ``sudo apt-get install make``
        - Install zip: ``sudo apt-get install zip``

    - If you're on Windows 10 (not using WSL):
        - [Install mingw (msys-base)](https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/).
        - Add ``mingw install path``\msys\1.0\bin to Windows path.

    - If you're on macOS
        - Install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
        - Install command line developer tools

* [PyPI](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installation/)

        sudo apt-get install python3-pip (Linux)
        sudo pip3 install pip --upgrade (Windows)

* Additional Python Modules (install using [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi))

        sudo pip install pytest tox --upgrade

In order to run the **[nimi-python](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)** system tests:

* Install the corresponding driver runtimes.
    * Download the latest installers for NI-DCPower, NI-Digital Pattern Driver, NI-DMM, NI-FGEN, NI-SCOPE, NI-SWITCH, and NI Switch Executive from [ni.com](http://www.ni.com/downloads/ni-drivers/)
    * NI-ModInst is included as part of these runtimes.
    * NI-TClk is included as part of NI-SCOPE and NI-FGEN.

### How to build

1. Fork the repository on GitHub and clone it to your local system.
1. On a terminal, navigate to the **[nimi-python](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)** root
   directory. Then run the ``tox`` command. It will do the following, for each driver:

      * Generate Python bindings
      * Generate [RST documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
      * Create installer packages
      * Run [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/)
      * Generate [HTML documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
      * Iterate over all python versions and run the NI-FAKE unit tests for each installed version of Python

1. To clean everything and start fresh, type: ``tox -e clean``

### Running System Tests

System tests exercise the Python bindings. After you have successfully built
**[nimi-python](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)**, install the locally built PyPI
packages using PyPI. For example:

    python3 -m pip install -U generated/nidmm/dist/nidmm-0.1.0.dev4-py2.py3-none-any.whl

You can install all locally built packages in one fell swoop using the following command.
This will work on Unix-based systems including Windows Subsystem for Linux.

    find generated | grep \.whl | xargs sudo python3 -m pip install -U

Once the Python bindings are installed, you can run the system tests for the desired driver. For example:

    pytest src/nidmm/system_tests

You can also use ``tox`` to run the system tests for the desired driver, *using all installed Python versions*. For example:

    tox -c generated\nidmm\tox-system-tests.ini


Contributing
------------

After you've verified that you can successfully build and run system tests for
**[nimi-python](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)**, you may fork the repository and
begin contributing to to the project.

1. Write a failing test for the new feature / bugfix.
    * If you are modifying the code generator, write new [NI-FAKE](src/nifake/tests) unit
      tests. If the new functionality requires changes to [metadata](src/nifake/metadata),
      apply those to NI-FAKE.
    * If you are modifying driver-specific metadata, write new
      [system tests](src/nidmm/system_tests).
1. Make your change.
1. Verify all tests, including the new ones, pass.
1. Update CHANGELOG.md if applicable.
    * If the change applies to all generated driver bindings, put the change into the **ALL** section
    * If it only applies to a single driver binding, put the change in the section associated with that driver
1. On GitHub, send a New pull request to the main repository's master branch. GitHub
   pull requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this project.
