for more details.


Setting up your system
----------------------

In order to have the ability to build and run the tests you will need a few things to be set up on your system.

### Windows:

- Install and enable [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide)
- Install the following in **Windows Subsystem for Linux**:
  - GNU Make: ``sudo apt-get install make``
  - zip: ``sudo apt-get install zip``
  - 64-bit [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    -- Use the version that `build_test` uses. See `envlist` definition in [tox.ini](./tox.ini)

### macOS:

- Install [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- Install command line developer tools
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    - Use the version that `build_test` uses. See `envlist` definition in [tox.ini](./tox.ini)

### Linux:

- Install Python: ``sudo apt-get install python3-pip``
    - Use the version that `build_test` uses. See `envlist` definition in [tox.ini](./tox.ini)

### All:

Once your system has been setup with the above, install required additional Python modules using PyPI.

        sudo pip install pytest tox --upgrade


Building **[`nimi-python`](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)**
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python) on GitHub and clone it to your local system.
1. On a terminal, navigate to the **[`nimi-python`](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)** root
   directory. Then run

       tox

   It will do the following, for each driver:

    * Validate the code generator and build scripts
    * Generate Python bindings
    * Generate [RST documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
     * Create installer packages
     * Run [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/)
     * Generate [HTML documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/)
     * Iterate over all installed and supported Python versions and run unit tests

1. To clean everything and start fresh

        tox -e clean


Running the system tests
------------------------

**[`nimi-python`](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)** includes system tests that exercise the Python modules against the real driver runtimes. Our CI includes invoking [`nimibot`](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python/wiki/nimibot-System-Test-machine) to run these tests for you on PRs pending admin approval.

But it is recommended that during development you run the system tests locally, especially if the areas of the code affected by your changes may impact interaction with the driver runtimes.

In order to run the **[nimi-python](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)** system tests locally:

### Install the corresponding driver runtimes.

Download and install the latest versions for the supported driver runtimes from [ni.com](http://www.ni.com/downloads/ni-drivers/):
* NI-DCPower
* NI-Digital Pattern Driver
* NI-DMM
* NI-FGEN
* NI-SCOPE
* NI-SWITCH
* NI Switch Executive

NI-ModInst and NI-TClk are included with the above, they have no separate installers.

### Install build artifacts

After you have successfully built **[nimi-python](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)**, install the locally built PyPI packages using PyPI:

    find generated | grep \.whl | xargs sudo python3 -m pip install -U

Once the Python bindings are installed, run the system tests for the desired driver. For example:

    pytest src/nidmm/system_tests -c generated/nidmm/tox-system_tests.ini

You can also use ``tox`` to run the system tests for the desired driver, *using all installed Python versions*. For example:

    tox -c generated/nidmm/tox-system_tests.ini


Contributing
------------

After you've verified that you can successfully build and run system tests for
**[`nimi-python`](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python)**, you may
begin contributing to to the project.

1. If applicable, write a failing test for the new feature / bugfix.
    * If you are modifying the code generator, write new [NI-FAKE](src/nifake/tests) unit
      tests. If the new functionality requires changes to [metadata](src/nifake/metadata),
      apply those to NI-FAKE.
    * If you are modifying driver-specific metadata, write new
      [system tests](src/nidmm/system_tests).
1. Make your change.
1. Verify all tests, including the new ones, pass.
1. Update CHANGELOG.md for customer-visible changes.
    * Put the change into the Unreleased section for each package that it applies to.
    * If it's a common change for all the packages, include the `(Common)` string before the newly added change in [CHANGELOG.md].
    * DO NOT MENTION: Internal-only changes like refactors or test improvements.
1. Commit modifications to generated files.
1. On GitHub, send a New pull request to the main repository's master branch. GitHub
   pull requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this project.

Release Process
---------------
1. Pre-Release Steps
    1. Checkout the master branch and pull down the latest changes
        ```bash
        git checkout master
        # Discard all local changes
        git restore .
        # Merge changes from upstream
        git pull upstream master
        ```
    1. Build master to ensure it is in a good state and ready for release
        ```bash
        tox -e clean
        tox
        ```
    1. Ensure no commits are made on ni/nimi-python/master until the release is complete
    1. Create and checkout a branch for release-related changes
    1. Perform Version Bump (If Needed)
        * If you need to upgrade the major or minor versions, include any of the following parameters:
           * --increment-major-version - To increment the major version of package. This will update the version to (N+1).X.X.dev0
           * --increment-minor-version - To increment the minor version of package. This will update the version to X.(N+1).X.dev0
             * Example: `python3 tools/build_release.py --increment-minor-version`
        * If you need to update the version for any specific driver(s), include the `drivers` parameter. By default, all drivers will be considered.
          For example: 
              ```bash
              python3 tools/build_release.py --drivers nidcpower --increment-minor-version
              ```
        * Commit to branch
    1. Update [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)
        * For packages that are releasing:
          * Delete empty (i.e. No changes) sub-sections under "Unreleased" section 
          * Remove the Unreleased section from the TOC if there are no changes for the package.
          * Change the "Unreleased" header to the version of the release
          * Change [Unreleased] in TOC to the version of the release
        * Commit to branch
    1. Update release versions
        * `python3 tools/build_release.py --update-for-release`
            * For each module, this will drop the .devN from our versions in config_addon.py and update the LATEST_RELEASE versions to match.
            * If you need to release any specific module(s), include the `drivers` parameter. 
          For example: 
              ```bash
              python3 tools/build_release.py --drivers nidcpower --update-for-release
              ```
        * Commit to branch
    1. Clean and build to update generated files with new version
        * `python3 tools/build_release.py --build`
        * Commit to branch
    1. Create a pull request
        * It should contain all the changes made so far
        * Get the pull request reviewed but DO NOT merge to master yet
1. Release Steps
    1. Wait until the pull request has been approved
    1. Upload the releases to PyPI
        * `python3 tools/build_release.py --upload`
        * If you need to upload any specific module(s), include the `drivers` parameter. 
        For example: 
             ```bash
            python3 tools/build_release.py --drivers nidcpower --upload
            ```
        * You will need to type in your PyPI credentials
    1. Merge the pull request to origin/master
    1. For each package released, create a release on GitHub using the module's portion from the changelog for this release for the description
        * The release tag should be named as follows: `MODULE_NAME-version`.
          * Example: `nidcpower-1.5.0`.
          * This tag format allows the individual `Read the Docs` projects to determine whether a release applies to them.
        * Add the ZIP files under `generated/examples` for each module (not just the releasing one) as a release artifact.
          * Internal test code will only look for the latest release tag and expect it to have examples attached for any module
        * This should trigger the [check_latest_release](.github/workflows/check_latest_release.yml) workflow. Check the [results](https://github.com/ni/nimi-python/actions/workflows/check_latest_release.yml) before continuing.
1. Post-Release Steps
    1. Create and checkout another branch for post-release changes
    1. Update the module version for a patch version upgrade. This will update the version to X.X.(N+1).dev0
        * `python3 tools/build_release.py --increment-patch-version`
        * If you need to update any specific module(s), include the `drivers` parameter. 
        For example: 
             ```bash
            python3 tools/build_release.py --drivers nidcpower --increment-patch-version
            ```
        * Commit to branch
    1. Clean and build to update generated files with new version
        * `python3 tools/build_release.py --build`
        * Ensure that all changes made as part of build command are specific to intended drivers.
        * Commit to branch
    1. Update changelog
        * Copy Unreleased section from the bottom of the changelog. Modify the package name in the example and TOC. Paste the modified section at the top of intended package's changelog and add a corresponding link to it in the package's TOC.
        * Commit to branch
    1. Create a pull request containing post-release changes and get it merged
