Getting Started
---------------

To contribute to this project, it is recommended that you follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Build. Unit tests will execute as part of this.
   - To build on a Windows Machine
      1. Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ . 
      2. Add Python install location to the Windows path.
      3. Install PyPI, following the instructions on https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/ .
      4. Install required Python Modules using PyPI.
         - wheel (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel/) .
         - mock (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock/) .
         - mako (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mako/) .
      5. Install mingw (msys-base) following the instructions on http://www.mingw.org/wiki/Getting_Started/ . 
      6. Add <mingw Install Path>\msys\1.0\bin to Windows path.
      7. Call "make clean".
      8. Call "make".
3. Run system tests on your system (see Testing section). At this point,
   if any tests fail, do not begin development. Try to investigate these
   failures. If you're unable to do so, report an issue through our
   `GitHub issues page <http://github.com/nimi-python/issues>`_.
4. Write new unit tests  and system tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that these
   new tests fail.
5. Make your change.
6. Run all the tests again (which include the tests you just added),
   and confirm that they all pass.
7. Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository's master branch. GitHub
   Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this project.

Testing
-------

Unit tests are self-contained and invoked as part of the build process.

System tests are distinct on a per-driver basis and require the following:

  - Full driver or runtime is installed (i.e. NI-DMM).
  - Supported version of CPython is installed.
  - Compatible device is connected to it (i.e. NI 4080).

* TODO(marcoskirsch): update all this when we have clearer information*

NI-DMM system tests assume your device has a specific alias "DMM1" specified in MAX. Rename your device in MAX to match.

To run the **nidmm** unit tests in a specific version of Python, run the following command in the root of the distribution::

  $ <Python executable> setup.py test

To run the unit tests in all Python interpreters supported by **nidmm**,
run the following commands in the root of the distribution::

  $ pip install tox
  $ tox

This requires you to have all the Python interpreters supported by
**nidmm** installed on your machine.
