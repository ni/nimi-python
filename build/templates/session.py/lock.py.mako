        Obtains a multithread lock on the device session. Before doing so, the
        software waits until all other execution threads release their locks
        on the device session.

        Other threads may have obtained a lock on this session for the
        following reasons:

            -  The application called the lock method.
            -  A call to ${config['driver_name']} locked the session.
            -  After a call to the lock method returns
               successfully, no other threads can access the device session until
               you call the unlock method or exit out of the with block when using
               lock context manager.
            -  Use the lock method and the
               unlock method around a sequence of calls to
               instrument driver methods if you require that the device retain its
               settings through the end of the sequence.

        You can safely make nested calls to the lock method
        within the same thread. To completely unlock the session, you must
        balance each call to the lock method with a call to
        the unlock method.

        Returns:
            lock (context manager): When used in a with statement, ${config['module_name']}.Session.lock acts as
            a context manager and unlock will be called when the with block is exited
