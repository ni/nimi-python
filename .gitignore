# The "generated" folder is created during a build.
# Normally you wouldn't want build artifacts to be in source control.
# But we actually do keep the latest copy of some of the generated code, specifically the Python modules, for two reasons:
#   1. So that we can make changes to the generator and easily review what effect those changes have in the generated code.
#   2. So that our system tests can create a wheel out of the files and quickly install them, instead of going through the full code-generation process.
# These are the generated files we do NOT want in git
